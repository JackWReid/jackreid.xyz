When we booked the trip, it didn’t occur to me — the significance of coming to the nation’s capital for our final stop. The capital was a good place to reflect back on all our stops over the past few weeks. It feels apart from the diverse country we just travelled all over. Yet, it contains the foci of pretty much every institution, every historical thread, every agency, every major national incident in the United States. There’s a museum for everything.

In Washington, with its meticulous and deeply metaphorically loaded city grid, its acres of methodically planned parks and malls, you are never more aware of the deliberate architecture of the country. Is that a good representation of the country as a whole? Definitely not. However, it’s the best place to understand the idea behind this gigantic maelstrom of a country. I’m glad I got to get amongst it. I look forward to coming back and seeing a little more.
