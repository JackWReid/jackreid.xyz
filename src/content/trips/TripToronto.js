    <p>I feel like we probably didn’t do Toronto justice. It’s our halfway point, and we’ve got three amazing cities coming up — with a week in each. We want to have as much energy as we possibly can to throw into discovering them, and we want to be caught up on rest from the streak of short stops we just had. So yeah, we ordered some takeout and yeah, we didn’t explore outside of our own neighbourhood that much. But you know what, we ate some amazing food and we watched a whole season of House of Cards — so there.</p>
