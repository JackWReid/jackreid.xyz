    "title": "A Feminist Critique of Murakami Novels, With Murakami Himself",
    "description": "Photo ©SHINCHOSHA\nHaruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo. His work has been translated into more than 50 languages, and he has been the recipient of a host of international awards and honours including the Franz Kafka Prize and the Jerusalem Prize. He has also received honorary doctorates from the University of Liege and Princeton University in recognition of his works. \nMieko Kawakami was born in Osaka prefecture in 1976 and began her career as a singer and songwriter before making her literary debut in 2006. Her first novella My Ego, My Teeth, and the World, published in 2007, was nominated for the Akutagawa Prize and awarded the Tsubouchi Shoyo Prize for Young Emerging Writers. The following year, Kawakami published Breasts and Eggs as a short novella. It won the Akutagawa Prize, Japan’s most prestigious literary honor, and earned praise from the acclaimed writer Yoko Ogawa. Kawakami is also the author of the novels Heaven, The Night Belongs to Lovers, and the newly expanded Breasts and Eggs, her first novel to be published in English. She lives in Japan.\n*\n\nArticle continues after advertisement \nMieko Kawakami: I’m curious about the character Mariye Akigawa from Killing Commendatore. I could tell how stressed she was by the way that her identity is so connected to her breasts. This hasn’t been the case for the young women in your other novels. I can easily relate to characters like Yuki in Dance Dance Dance, or May Kasahara in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.\nI’m thinking of the scene where May Kasahara talks about “the lump of death…round and squishy, like a softball.” Discussion of the protagonist aside, May has these incredibly powerful lines throughout the novel, about the murky distinction between hurting yourself and hurting others, or your own death and the death of others. The prose is fantastic. It captures the spirit of exactly what it’s like to be a girl. I love those passages so much. Yuki and May don’t talk much about their breasts or their bodies. But Mariye in Killing Commendatore…\nHaruki Murakami: She’s really fixated on them. It’s almost an obsession.\nMK: Sure, but don’t you think she’s a little too fixated, though? The second she’s alone with the first-person narrator, this guy she’s never met before, the first words out of her mouth are something like, “My breasts are really small, don’t you think?” I found this pretty surprising. Where does this obsession with breasts come from?\nHM: I wouldn’t really say it came from anywhere. I just imagine there are girls out there who feel this way.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement \nMK: But what about the gap between her and the narrator?…When Mariye starts asking him about her breasts, did you struggle at all over how he should respond?\nHM: I know what you’re saying. But the fact that she asks him for his opinion on her breasts suggests that she doesn’t really see him as a man. She doesn’t recognize him as a sexual object. This strengthens the introspectiveness, or philosophical nature, of their dialogue. That’s the sort of relationship that Mariye wants from him. I have a feeling she’s been searching for a while for a person she can ask about this stuff. I think we can agree that, generally speaking, if you see a chance of becoming a sexual object in someone’s eyes, you don’t start off by talking about how your breasts aren’t growing, or how small your nipples are.\nMK: I see your point, though actually I saw the opposite possibility. As in, Mariye starts things off that way to make him view her sexually. But you’re saying that it purges the air of any kind of sexual tension between them, and strengthens the philosophical aspect of their interaction?\nHM: Right. As a result, the dialogue between Mariye and the narrator becomes one of the driving forces of the novel. Their exchange sheds new light on the story.\nMK: In other words, the conversation provides us with more information on the personality and demeanor of the narrator—who would otherwise remain something of a mystery to readers.\nHM: That’s right. He’s the sort of person who a twelve-year-old girl would feel comfortable talking to about her breasts. He has that kind of personality.\nMK: That brings me to another question about the women in your novels. Something that comes up rather often when talking about your work. I’m thinking of the way that women are depicted, the roles they’re assigned.\nIt’s common for my female friends to say to me, “If you love Haruki Murakami’s work so much, how do you justify his portrayal of women?” The notion being that there’s something disconcerting about the depiction of women in your stories. It irks some people, men and women alike.\nA common reading is that your male characters are fighting their battles unconsciously, on the inside, leaving the women to do the fighting in the real world.\nHM: Really? How so?\nMK: It goes beyond whether they’re realistic, or come across as “real-life women.” It has more to do with the roles they play. For example, as we were saying earlier, the woman functions as a kind oracle, in that she’s made to act as a medium of fate.\nHM: She takes you by the hand and leads you off somewhere.\nMK: Exactly. She triggers a metamorphosis in the protagonist. There are many cases where women are presented as gateways, or opportunities for transformation.\nHM: Sure, I can see there being elements of that.\nMK: In these transformations, as long as sex is being posited as a way into an unfamiliar realm, the women, when faced with a heterosexual protagonist, have basically no choice but to play the role of sexual partner. Looking at it from a certain angle, I think plenty of readers would argue that women are forever in this situation, forced into an overly sexual role, simply because they’re women. I’d love to hear your thoughts on that.\nHM: I’m not sure I follow. When you say more than the necessary role, you mean…?\nMK: I’m talking about the large number of female characters who exist solely to fulfill a sexual function. On the one hand, your work is boundlessly imaginative when it comes to plots, to wells, and to men, but the same can’t be said for their relationships with women. It’s not possible for these women to exist on their own. And while female protagonists, or even supporting characters, may enjoy a moderate degree of self-expression, thanks to their relative independence, there’s a persistent tendency for women to be sacrificed for the sake of the male leads. So the question is, why is it that women are so often called upon to play this role in Murakami novels?\nHM: Now I see, okay.\nMK: Would you mind sharing your thoughts on that?\nHM: This may not be the most satisfying explanation, but I don’t think any of my characters are that complex. The focus is on the interface, or how these people, both men and women, engage with the world they’re living in. If anything, I take great care not to dwell too much on the meaning of existence, its importance or its implications. Like I said earlier, I’m not interested in individualistic characters. And that applies to men and women both.\nMK: I see.\nHM: I will say that 1Q84 was the most time I’ve spent engaging with a female character. Aomame is incredibly important to Tengo, and Tengo is incredibly important to Aomame. They never seem to wind up crossing paths. But the story centers on their movement toward each other. They have shared status as protagonists. At the very end, they’re finally brought together. Two become one. There’s nothing erotic, up until the end. In that sense, I’d say they’re equals, in the broad scheme of the novel, since the book depends upon them both in equal measure.\nMK: Your longer novels often revolve around some kind of battle against larger forces. The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle pits Toru and Kumiko Okada against Noboru Wataya, and 1Q84 has Aomame and Tengo fighting a mighty evil force. What these two novels have in common is that the men are fighting in the realm of the unconscious.\nHM: When you put it that way, sure. Maybe it’s a matter of the usual gender roles being reversed. How would you see it from a feminist perspective? I’m not sure myself.\nThese women aren’t just novelistic instruments for me. Each individual work calls for its own circumstances. I’m not making excuses. I’m speaking from feeling and experience.\nMK: A common reading is that your male characters are fighting their battles unconsciously, on the inside, leaving the women to do the fighting in the real world. For example, in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, it’s Kumiko who pulls the plug on the life support system, kills Noboru Wataya, and ultimately pays the price. And in 1Q84, the Leader is killed by Aomame. Granted, it isn’t necessary to apply a feminist critique to every single novel, and a pursuit of rectitude is not why any writer turns to fiction, but reading these books from a feminist perspective, the common reaction would likely be: “Okay, here’s another woman whose blood has been shed for the sake of a man’s self-realization.”\nMost women in the real world have had experiences where being a woman made life unlivable. Like victims of sexual assault, who are accused of asking for it. It comes down to the fact that making a woman feel guilty for having a woman’s body is equivalent to negating her existence. There are probably some women out there who have never thought this way, but there’s an argument to be made that they’ve been pressured by society into stifling their feelings. Which is why it can be so exhausting to see this pattern show up in fiction, a reminder of how women are sacrificed for the sake of men’s self-realization or sexual desire.\nHM: I think that any pattern is probably coincidental. At a minimum, I never set things up like that on purpose. I guess it’s possible for a story to work out that way, on a purely unconscious level. Not to sound dismissive, but my writing doesn’t follow any kind of clear-cut scheme. Take Norwegian Wood, where Naoko and Midori are respectively grappling with their subconscious and conscious existences. The first-person male narrator is captivated by them both. And it threatens to split his world in two. Then there’s After Dark. The story is propelled almost exclusively by the will of the female characters. So I can’t agree that women are always stuck playing the supporting role of sexual oracles or anything along those lines. Even once I’ve forgotten the storylines, these women stay with me. Like Reiko or Hatsumi in Norwegian Wood. Even now, thinking about them makes me emotional. These women aren’t just novelistic instruments for me. Each individual work calls for its own circumstances. I’m not making excuses. I’m speaking from feeling and experience.\nMK: I see what you mean. As a writer myself, I’m thoroughly familiar with what you mean by feeling. At the same time, I can see how readers might come away with the kind of reading experience we’ve been discussing.\nThere’s something really important to me about what you’ve been saying, this idea that in your opinion, women can go beyond sexualization, or exist wholly apart from it, and take the story in an entirely different direction.\nI can only tackle these complicated questions through fiction. Without demanding it be positive or negative, the best that I can do is approach these stories, as they are, inside of me.\nHM: Right. I do feel that women have rather different functions from men. Maybe it’s cliché, but this is how men and women survive—helping each other, making up for what the other lacks. Sometimes that means swapping gender roles or functions. I think it depends on the person, and on their circumstances, whether they see this as natural or artificial, as just or unjust. Whether they see gender differences as involving stark opposition, or being in harmonious balance. Perhaps it’s less about making up for what we lack, so much as cancelling each other out. In my case, I can only tackle these complicated questions through fiction. Without demanding it be positive or negative, the best that I can do is approach these stories, as they are, inside of me. I’m not a thinker, or a critic, or a social activist. I’m just a novelist. If someone tells me that my work is flawed when viewed through a particular ism, or could have used a bit more thought, all that I can do is offer a sincere apology and say, “I’m sorry.” I’ll be the first guy to apologize. \n*\nMK: In the hardboiled novels of Raymond Chandler, women usually show up with a mission, or a job for the man to perform. To some extent, your work must draw from a reserve of how women are depicted in the novels that you’ve read, since what we read is hugely influential on what we write.\nBut of all the women that you’ve written, the one that stays with me most persistently is the protagonist in the short story “Sleep” (The Elephant Vanishes, 1993). I’ve read lots of female characters written by women and lots of female characters written by men, but to this day, I’ve never encountered another woman like the character in “Sleep.” It’s an extraordinary achievement.\nHM: That story was published in the New Yorker, at a point when I was basically an unknown writer in America. Most of the people who read it evidently thought that “Haruki Murakami” was a woman. I’ve actually received a lot of letters from women thanking me for writing it so well. Never saw that coming.\nMK: Am I correct that “Sleep” is the first time you wrote a story from a woman’s perspective?\nHM: Yes, I think that’s right.\nMK: What was it about that moment that made you want to focus on a female character? Did it just sort of happen on its own?\nHM: I wrote that story when I was living in Rome. Not exactly verging on a nervous breakdown, but seriously agitated by the publicity surrounding Norwegian Wood, which was a runaway bestseller in Japan. I’d had enough, and wanted to escape into another world. So I left Japan for Italy and laid low for a while. I got sort of depressed, which made writing impossible. But one day, I had the urge to write something again, and that’s when I wrote “TV People” and “Sleep.” I remember it was early spring.\nMK: Which story did you finish first? “TV People”?\nHM: I think “TV People” came first. I saw one of Lou Reed’s music videos on MTV, and I was so inspired that I basically wrote it in one go. Then I turned to a female narrator for “Sleep.” That felt like the best way of expressing what I was feeling at the time. I wanted some distance, perhaps even from myself. Maybe that’s why I went with a female protagonist. From what I can recall, I wrote that one pretty quickly too.\nMK: “Sleep” is stunning. Not being able to sleep is like living in a world where death doesn’t exist. The disquiet, that distinct brand of tension that never lets up for an instant. It’s the perfect metaphor for a woman’s existence… I’m assuming it took you a few days to write? Considering it’s a short story.\nHM: Sure, but I’d say it took about a week to polish.\nMK: I know that I’ve spent more than a few days working through “Sleep” line by line. I’ve really never read a woman like this before. As a woman, it was such a joy to encounter a “new woman” in a text. All the more surprising because she was written by a man. Reading it was such a wonderful experience for me.\nOut of all the female characters in your fiction, the woman in “Sleep” stands above the rest for me. As a feminist, when I found this character, it built a sense of trust between me and your work—and a tremendous sense of trust at that. In practical terms, this means a confidence in the writing, in the words themselves… I know you’ve done Japanese translations of short stories by the female writer Grace Paley, so maybe there’s some kind of connection there. In terms of how you create female characters.\nHM: I wouldn’t necessarily say that. I decided to translate Grace Paley’s fiction because I find it really interesting. I wasn’t really conscious of how she depicted women. When I was writing “Sleep,” I just wrote down whatever I was thinking, figuring this was what a woman would be like under the circumstances. The narrator just happened to be a woman that time around. I wasn’t making any conscious effort to explore the female mind.\nAs a woman, it was such a joy to encounter a “new woman” in a text. All the more surprising because she was written by a man. \nMK: When writing a female character, there are certain motifs that can be used to satisfy the expectations of male or female readers about what makes for a believable woman, but this story doesn’t have any of that.\nHM: Except for the ending, when she parks her car at the waterfront at night. In that one scene, I was keenly aware of the main character being a woman. Two guys surround a woman’s car on a dark night and start rocking it back and forth? That must be really scary.\nMK: It would be pretty scary for a man too, but maybe more so for a woman.\nHM: In every other respect, I wrote the character to be a human being, without really being conscious of her as a woman.\nMK: Right. I think it’s this way of creating distance, focusing on the human—because that’s what it is, the human aspects of the female character—that illuminates her status as a woman, at least in my mind. I’ve never read a woman like this anywhere else. What a wonderful story.\nHM: Looking back, I think it could have worked equally well if the main character was a househusband and the wife was a female doctor or a dentist, and the husband can’t sleep and is awake all hours of the night, cooking and doing laundry or what have you. Still, that would have been different in some ways, I suppose.\nMK: I think it’s important that the couple has a son. It’s the woman who gave birth. Her awareness of this gives her a sense of despair that the father can’t exactly share.\nHM: There’s also the resentment that she feels toward her husband. I feel like that kind of resentment is unique to women.\nMK: It goes beyond resentment, but there’s definitely something there.\nHM: Yeah. Sometimes when I’m walking around the house, I can feel it behind me. Seeping into the room.\nMK: I’ll take seeping any day. In most marriages, it’s a flash flood! So, I’m thinking about how the son and father are depicted doing things in similar ways, like how they wave to her. Because the resentment isn’t spelled out for you as such, the reader gets to process it as this unnamable sensation. Having her read Anna Karenina is a good touch too.\nHM: Anna Karenina. Another classic example of resentment toward a husband. Maybe Tolstoy, in his home life, felt the same kind of tension seeping into the room.\nMK: You’ve written lots of male characters in your career, but do you think it’s possible that in future books there will be female examples of characters like Menshiki in Killing Commendatore, who are a little bit mysterious or unfamiliar, characters who make you say, “Whoa, this is new”? Or do you suppose the female characters will continue to play this sort of mythological role, more of a pragmatic function?\nHM: I’ll continue creating new characters, different from the ones that came before, which certainly applies to women too. Like Shoko Akigawa, for example, who may be a supporting character, but in my view is a departure from most of the characters I’ve written. There’s something really special about her to me. I have this desire to learn more about her. I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface.\nMK: I’d be curious to know what she’s been reading. What do you think is on her nightstand? The grittiest hardboiled novels she can find? I’m dying to know. Like, when she sits down with a book, what would it be? I’m coming up short.\nHM: Probably something epic, like Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\nMK: Shoko’s a tough cookie, huh? Some novels give you all the details on a female character, her hairstyle, her clothes…like in Chandler, where the first time we see a woman we get a head-to-toe description, giving you a clear image of her. In your novels, the characterization has a tendency to start off with minute details about clothes. Where do you go for information about women’s clothing?\nHM: I don’t go anywhere. I just write what I’m thinking. I don’t spend my time researching that sort of thing. As I form the image of a female character, what she wears naturally falls into place. Although I will say… perhaps I do pay close attention to women’s clothes in real life. I’m something of a shopper myself.\nMK: The wife in “Tony Takitani” (Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman, 2002) is a compulsive shopper, which is how she ends up dying in a car crash at the end. Every time she thinks about clothes, she gets the shakes, a detail which I absolutely love.\nAs we talk things over, I’m reminded of the variety of female characters you’ve written. I wouldn’t say that all the women fit into a single category. Though of course, writing a female character is not the same thing as making her important to the story.\nHM: To be honest, I don’t understand this idea about there being any kind of pattern. We can talk about the women in my novels as a group, but to me, they’re unique individuals, and on a fundamental level, before I see them as a man or woman, I see them as a human being. But all of that aside, what about the wife in “The Little Green Monster” (The Elephant Vanishes, 1993)? She’s a scary one, isn’t she?\nMK: Yeah, there’s her too.\nWe can talk about the women in my novels as a group, but to me, they’re unique individuals, and on a fundamental level, before I see them as a man or woman, I see them as a human being. \nHM: I was exploring a kind of cruelty that women seem to possess. I can feel it when it’s there, but can’t claim access to it. I don’t want to get in trouble for going back to differences between genders, but I think this sort of cruelty is rare in men. Men can of course be cruel, but I think they go about it in more structured ways. They come at you with logic, or like a total psychopath. But the cruelty of women is more ordinary, everyday. Now and then, they catch you unawares. Surprisingly, a lot of female readers seem to have enjoyed “The Little Green Monster.” Or maybe that’s not surprising at all?\nMK: Yeah, a lot of my friends love that one. It’s definitely one of my favorites too. How can I put this. It’s like the scariness doesn’t register as scary, which allows the reader to accept it as completely normal. It’s a familiar kind of cruelty.\n*\nThe above interview has been translated from Japanese by Sam Bett and David Boyd.",

    "title": "We’re All Dancers Now - Mindful Movement Is Key to Social Distancing",
    "description": "I really liked How We Use Our Bodies to Navigate a Pandemic by NY Times dance critic Gia Kourlas on how many people struggle with the awareness of what their bodies are doing in public and that social distancing measures require a higher level of attentiveness to how we move and coordinate our movements with others.\n\n\nIn this time of confinement, we have been given one immeasurable gift — the freedom to go outside. In exchange, we must abide by a simple rule: Stay six feet away from others. As choreographic intentions go, that’s not remotely vague. Yet during my runs and walks in Brooklyn over the past few days, I’ve noticed that six feet doesn’t mean the same thing to everybody.\n\nSpatial awareness, like coordination, isn’t a given. Watching the choices people make when they move in public, much less in this time of social distancing, can be shocking, from the much-bemoaned tourist who comes to a grinding halt in Times Square to the woman with a yoga mat knocking people aside to get her spot on the floor. (It’s OK; she’ll still feel good about bowing her head and saying namaste.)\n\nNow the choreography of the streets has taken on higher stakes. It’s the difference between health and sickness, life and death. Inside we’re alone. Outside, a new alertness is in order, one that demands a deep connection to the position and movement of the body — or proprioception, sometimes referred to as the sixth sense.\n\n\n Tags: cities   COVID-19   dance   Gia Kourlas",

    "title": "Treating Coronavirus COVID-19: An Elmhurst Doctor Describes Hospital Overwhelmed By Patients On Ventilators",
    "description": "The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.   The center of New York City’s coronavirus crisis is Elmhurst Hospital Center. The 545-bed facility, in Queens, has in recent days experienced the full brunt of an unprecedented public health crisis: long lines to receive medical care, a chaotic emergency room, supplies and equipment dwindling dangerously low, an overfull morgue, and medical workers themselves contracting and suffering from the virus. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that 13 patients died at Elmhurst from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, in the preceding 24-hour period.\nThe area the hospital serves — what the New Yorker’s Rivka Galchen called in 2013 “the most diverse neighborhood in New York City and maybe in the world” — is a hub for immigrants. According to Galchen’s story, the hospital offers translation services in 153 languages. As such, it’s not just a symbol of the city’s straining public health system, but the immigrant city itself.\nLast night, BuzzFeed News spoke with a physician at Elmhurst who has been treating coronavirus patients. The doctor, who estimated that there are currently around 60 intubated COVID-19 patients at the hospital, requested anonymity so he could speak freely. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nDescribe what’s happening in the hospital right now.\nElmhurst is just getting destroyed. It’s very, very gruesome. The hospital has a 15-bed intensive care unit that would normally cover respiratory patients or patients with any significant illness requiring intubation, like pneumonia, liver injury, encephalopathy, or kidney problems. What’s remarkable is that now, every patient is a COVID patient. And they’re all ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome, a life-threatening fluid buildup in the lungs].\nThere is a nine-bed medical intensive care unit — those are all ARDS. Then you have a 30-bed stepdown unit. That’s all intubated COVID patients. Then there’s the general medicine floor. That’s all intubated COVID patients. You walk into the hospital and you think, Not only is the virus infecting people — it’s infecting the hospital itself. It’s pushing out everything else. It’s all COVID. That’s insane.\nTo make things worse, Elmhurst, which basically is held together by a shoestring in the best of times, is being pushed to the brink.\nBeing pushed to the brink, how?\nThe hospital used to have four pulmonology and critical attendings [doctors who specialize in treating critical respiratory illness]. Four attendings seems small but it’s usually fine. When you’re asking them to see five to six times the number of patients as normal, it becomes absurd. One of those attendings left a month ago, and one is sick. So now you have two attending physicians seeing all these patients. And now you have normal medicine teams who are used to seeing diarrhea, alcohol withdrawal, UTIs, stuff that is very mild, who are now being asked to deal with the most complicated, intubated, multi-organ failure patients. I’ve never seen anything like it before.    They might be intubated and vented but just lying in the ER and waiting. \n  The ER has a huge backflow of patients. Like there might be 12 patients designated for admission but there are no beds. These people are in purgatory. The emergency room has to manage them as a team. They might be intubated and vented but just lying in the ER and waiting while ER doctors are tending to however many people they have to see on their shift. These vented patients are very complicated. You have to check blood gasses every few hours to make sure you’re pushing in the right amount of oxygen and pulling out the right amount of carbon dioxide. There are people called respiratory techs who go to school for years for that. Normally you get a respiratory tech with a vented patient, but they’re spread so thin here.\nCOVID is a very deadly disease. Even with a perfect 1-to-1 ratio of doctors and perfect staffing, a lot of these people are going to die. But there are things you can do with more oversight and more expertise. The issue with Elmhurst is there aren’t enough intensivists — not enough specialists in respiratory disease. Everyone is trying to pitch in but people are being stretched very thin.   Do staff have enough personal protective equipment (PPE)?\nIt’s a motley collection. Everyone is wearing a mask. Everyone has a different assemblage of gear. The hospital is low on PPE. Some people bring in face shields from home. Some are wearing goggles. Some are wearing hair nets. Some are walking around in cutaway scrubs. Some have yellow gowns on top of the scrubs. Some people have helmets.\nYou’re supposed to wear an N95 mask with a face shield down, gloves, and when you’re done, you’re supposed to throw everything out. Now, there’s a shortage. And the hospital has so much infection, plus people’s technique is not perfect. People are very scared so they’re wearing one N95 all day, which — I don’t know how legitimate that is — then they put a different surgical mask on top of that one, then throw it out. I have one face shield that I have to keep rewashing after seeing every patient.   Who are the COVID patients, demographically?\nElmhurst is a super-diverse community. It’s Hispanic, Bengali, Pakistani, Polish, Guyanese. It’s everybody. It’s our normal patient population. The ages are terrifying, anywhere from thirties, forties, fifties, sixties, seventies. It’s obviously more people in their sixties and seventies. But every time there is a code [a cardiac arrest and medical response], they call out the room. And when they call out the room, residents run to their computer and look who is coding and how old they are. Today there were two 35-year-olds who died. And people are so freaked out by that.    Today there were two 35-year-olds who died. \n  It tends to be someone with a preexisting condition — one of these people had asthma, and one had obstructive sleep apnea. But this is mild stuff. We’re not talking about only quadriplegics. We’re talking about people who are basically doing well.\nHow is the morale of the staff?\nIt’s pretty common to see someone crying in the hallway. I saw that twice today. Something like 12 people died yesterday. [The New York Times reported 13 deaths.] These are bonkers numbers for a hospital, where you’d usually have you have one or two a day. They don’t even change in and out of PPE. They gear up one time, and that’s it for the whole shift. They don’t want to be exposed for a second, and lots of them are already calling out with fevers. The morale among ER people is extremely low. People are anxious, making morbid jokes about dying. Talking about what would happen if I quit, I didn’t sign up for this.\nThe chatter you hear outside of these units is very grim. An attending will come in and say, “I’m flashing back to Vietnam” or “it’s a fucking nightmare” or “this box of masks will last until Friday.” It’s bad.    There’s no visitors allowed in the hospital now so these people are dying alone. \n  The patients are all silent. Because they are being intubated and in medically induced comas. Normally patients this sick are surrounded by family, who are talking to you and asking questions, concerned, crying. But there’s no visitors allowed in the hospital now so these people are dying alone. There’s this awful quietness. This mechanical hiss, in and out, back and forth, of the ventilator.\nAs someone who takes care of critically ill patients, I’m used to seeing people on ventilators. I’m used to the idea that patients can’t respond. But normally not all of my patients are intubated — some people will be recovering. This is just so different. Everyone is doing worse all the time. The only way more vents are freeing up is more people are dying. It’s crushing.\nHow concerned are you personally about getting COVID-19?\nI’m extremely concerned. I’m terrified. I have a young child. I debated about sending my wife away, but I figured she works in health care too. She might infect my parents or her parents. What if she already had it and is asymptomatic? It’s all very morbid. I’m terrified.\nWhen I was training, I never thought about a day like this. The fact that this is spreading so quickly and is killing health care providers. It’s not just killing the uninformed. It’s killing people wearing PPE. It doesn’t really seem to have any kind of a bias. It’s just taking out everyone.\nHas this made you think differently about local, state, or federal leadership?\nWith Trump, it’s straightforward to say he has killed people by his response already, and will continue to kill people if he wants to reopen the country. Also, this is the guy who said vaccines have a link with autism, and now we expect him to lead the fight to find a vaccine for this?\nCuomo has done a good job of leading.\nIt’s insane to me that some states don’t have shelter-in-place laws.\nWhat’s the biggest misconception about this disease and the fight against it? What do you wish people knew?\nPeople read social media and newspapers and there is this idea that, Wow, these doctors are such heroes, going to front lines. They’re doing such a great job. In reality, I don't want to be a hero. I don’t want to be brave. I didn’t sign up for any of this. I feel extremely vulnerable and kind of trapped. If I don’t do this, I’ll lose my job, and if I do it, I could die. And it’s not a heroic feeling. It feels like being thrown into the fire. You’re a body, and you can take care of a ventilated patient — give it a shot. I would way rather not be doing this. ●   The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus.

    "title": "Our Personalized Quarantine Book Recommendations, Round 2",
    "description": "Last week, we put out a call asking that those of you who need something good to read in this trying, frightening time, might send us a few of your favorite books (and other things) so we could recommend a good book for you to read. And turns out quite a lot of you are looking for something new to read! We got hundreds of requests, from everywhere from Belgium to Rome to Cape Town to Ireland to Tasmania to Singapore. So firstly: thank you. We are all reading together in solidarity!\nYou can find our first round of answers, pulled from email, Facebook, and Twitter, here. Our second round is below. While we (still) haven’t been able to get to every request, we’re hoping to keep it up—so keep writing to us!—and we’re also hoping that these recommendations might be useful to more than just the people who requested them, which is why we are publishing them as a column here.\n\nKerry M. loves:\nMikhail Bulgakov, The Master and Margarita\nRichard Powers, The Overstory\nThe Pearl Poet, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\nLit Hub recommends:\nLooking at your list of masterful yet irreverent texts, I instantly thought of recent Nobel prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro’s quasi-Arthurian epic The Buried Giant, which begins with an elderly couple who set off through the mists and ogre-plagued lands to reconnect with their son—a son who, like their own pasts, they barely remember for some reason. This novel has . . . well, sometimes confused critics. But I suspect that you, Kerry, will enjoy it: and you’ll even meet someone you know along the way. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nYasmin S. loves:\nDonna Tartt, The Goldfinch and The Secret History\nMadeline Miller, The Song of Achilles and Circe\nJohn Steinbeck, East of Eden\nOttessa Moshfegh, My Year of Rest and Relaxation and Eileen\n(I’ve tried reading Ali Smith and Rachel Cusk, but for some reason I just couldn’t get into them.)\nLit Hub recommends:\nAh, novels to sink your teeth into! I completely relate—Circe and Song of Achilles were two of my recent favorites, too. I think you’d like Jennifer Egan’s Manhattan Beach, a cinematic novel set in New York City in the 1930s and 40s. It’s a novel of crimes and secrets as well as a deeply researched story of time and place. Like the two Madeline Millers, it demands that you leave the present behind as you read, which is perhaps the greatest gift a novel can give us right now. –Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor\n\nAndrea B. loves:\nDonna Tartt, The Secret History\nJohn Williams, Stoner\nMarisha Pessl, Night Film\nLit Hub recommends:\nBecause you like university settings and also the dark mood of Night Film, you may enjoy Black Chalk, by Christopher J. Yates, in which six students at Oxford start a game with increasing stakes and increasing consequences, and keep it going until things get pretty dark. Definite page-turner, too. Should keep your mind off things, and maybe make you a little glad to be away from other people.  –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nKaren V. loves:\nAnnie Dillard, Pilgrim At Tinker Creek\nBarbara Kingsolver, Prodigal Summer\nGabriel Garcia Marquez, Love In the Time of Cholera\nI’m looking for good, hopeful books about natural history to combat the deluge of doom-and-gloom climate chaos books. \nLit Hub recommends:\nKaren, I don’t blame you. We all need a little reprieve from bad news. I’m going to suggest a classic by a living legend: John McPhee’s Coming Into the Country (1976), which is all about Alaska: its landscapes and wilderness, its animals and settlers and miners, at a time before we could navigate places easily using our cell phones and GPS. McPhee is one of the most admired and prolific nonfiction writers working (and, I must proudly boast, a former teacher of mine). Coming Into the Country was the first of his books I got acquainted with, and Karen, when I say it’s good, I mean so good that Alaskans themselves consider it a seminal work of regional literature. –Aaron Robertson, Assistant Editor\n\nSydney W. loves:\nDonna Tartt, The Secret History\nTana French, In the Woods\nSandra Newman, The Heavens\nLit Hub recommends:\nAh, three of my favorites, all moody literary mysteries full of gorgeous writing. Same goes for Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca, Helen DeWitt’s The Last Samurai, and Lauren Groff’s Fates and Furies. If you’ve read all those, maybe you haven’t read The Vanishers, by Heidi Julavits—and either way, you should. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nIoana D. loves:\nMadeline Miller, The Song of Achilles\nBoyxboy fan fictions\nAudrey Niffenegger, The Time Traveler’s Wife\nLit Hub recommends:\nHi Ioana. I’m going to guess, based on your selections, that you like books that offer new, particular takes on history, and (this is less of a guess) play with time. Have you ever read Possession by A.S. Byatt? It’s a story about two archivists in the present whose lives grow entwined with one another’s as they become more and more obsessed researching a romance between two nineteenth-century writers. I might also try The Penelopiad by Margaret Atwood, which retells the Odyssey from the perspective of Odysseus’s wife, or Madeline Miller’s new book Circe, which offers a new take on Greek mythology’s most infamous witch. But also, on a different note, have you read Outlander by Diana Gabaldon? This might be the perfect time to start a very long book series. –Olivia Rutigliano, LitHub & CrimeReads staff writer\n\nJeanine K. loves:\nJoan Didion, Slouching Towards Bethlehem\nElena Ferrante, The Days of Abandonment\nVirginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse\nLit Hub recommends:\nYou have very good taste, Jeanine. I’ve been trying to tell people that Ferrante’s The Days of Abandonment is her best work (no shade to the Neapolitan series, but still) for years. Since you have a taste for modernism and the minds of complicated, brilliant, women, I think you’ll devour Speedboat, by Renata Adler. This goes double if you’re a writer yourself. They say everyone who reads it ends up writing a novel.  –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nRishitha S. loves:\nGarth Greenwell, Cleanness\nValeria Luiselli, The Lost Children Archive\nSarah Waters, Fingersmith\nLit Hub recommends:\nHi Rishitha, I also loved Cleanness! On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong might also strike your fancy; the protagonist’s account of childhood, intimate relationships, love, and sex is narrated with similarly gorgeous sentences. I also think you would like Gun Island by Amitav Ghosh, narrated by a rare book dealer whose story involves history, mythology, and questions about our future in the midst of a climate crisis. –Corinne Segal, Senior Editor\n\nP f loves:\nLaurie King’s Mary Russell books\nThe Outlander series\nLawrence Sanders, First Deadly Sin\nEric Von Lustbader’s The Ninja\nLit Hub recommends:\nHowdy! I also love the Mary Russell books. Have you tried Cara Black’s Aimee Leduc series? They have a very different setting, but for me, anyway, they itch the same scratch. I would also encourage you to read A Gentleman’s Murder by Christopher Huang if you’re craving that postwar setting. –Molly Odintz, CrimeReads Senior Editor\n\n@shioridotomo loves:\nAli Smith, Spring\nAndrew Krivak, The Bear\nLit Hub recommends:\nA fellow Ali Smith fan! My cop-out first reaction is: have you read her story collection First Person and Other Stories?! It’s weird and surreal and so beautiful. She’ll have you turning pages and doing double-takes the whole way through. (Get tissues in preparation for the last story.) I also want to recommend Max Porter’s Grief Is the Thing with Feathers, for the magical and heartbreaking way creatures guide us through life lessons.  –Katie Yee, Book Marks Assistant Editor\n\nShal M. loves:\nOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Grey\nGeorge Orwell, 1984\nAldous Huxley, Brave New World\nLit Hub recommends:\nI do love a good dystopia, Shal (in fiction, at least; current shades of the dystopian IRL have proven less fun…) For a humane and quietly heartbreaking take on the genre, I would recommend Nobel Prize-winner Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go. If you haven’t read it, I don’t want to give away too much about this melancholy, quasi-sci-fi coming-of-age tale, but it’s a lovely, understated, deeply sorrowful novel (the same can be said for Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day, which is even better btw!). –Dan Sheehan, Book Marks editor\n\nNero B. loves:\nMarge Piercy, Woman on the Edge of Time\nNaomi Alderman, The Power\nAngela Carter, The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories\nAmong so many more. I like prose written by women for women and one genre in particular, Sci Fi.\nLit Hub recommends:\nI imagine you’re read a lot of the classics already, considering your list, so let me recommend a more recent novel that I think you might like: Finnish author Johanna Sinisalo’s The Core of the Sun, translated into English by Lola Rogers in 2016. It’s set in an alternative historical present in which the Finnish government has bred a line of submissive, beautiful women called eloi—and sterilized all the intelligent ones. Told through multiple perspectives and including a chili pepper cult, it is totally unlike any of the other books out there—but I think that might be just what you need. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nMelisa Y. loves:\nJane Austen, Persuasion\nRuth Ware, In a Dark, Dark Wood\nThe Dead Files tv show on Travel Channel \nLit Hub recommends:\nIf you like Ruth Ware, then have I got some recommendations for you! Ware’s books impress with their signature mixture of gothic, psychological thriller, and traditional mystery (plus they’re super fun!). Here are a few books that also like to mix things up in these genres: check out Shari Lapena’s An Unwanted Guest, Rachel Howzell Hall’s They All Fall Down, and (especially for those who enjoy the disastrous party element of In a Dark, Dark Wood) try Lucy Foley’s upcoming The Guest List, or if you don’t want to wait till May, her equally good The Hunting Party. –Molly Odintz, CrimeReads Senior Editor\n\nAnna B. loves:\nHelen Oyeyemi, What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours\nItalo Calvino, Invisible Cities\nLiao Yiwu, The Corpse Walker\nLit Hub recommends:\nSince you have a strong love of fabulist literature and an interest in the struggles of the less than fortunate everyman, I think you will be moved by Kōbō Abe’s The Woman in the Dunes, a mesmerizing short novel in which an amateur entomologist who misses his bus takes shelter in the house of a woman who lives in the dunes—only to discover that he is trapped there, with this stranger, and that they are tasked every day to shovel and shovel and shovel to keep the sand at bay. It’s not, you know, uplifting. But it is very, very good. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nBillie E. loves:\nNora Ephron, I Feel Bad About My Neck\nAmor Towles, The Rules of Civility\nEmily St. John Mandel, Station Eleven\nLit Hub recommends:\nI can’t get enough of classic New York City stories these days, and I’ve also been reading a lot of Nora Ephron, an emblematic New York City personality if ever there was one. Being cooped up in my Brooklyn apartment, this seems to be the only way to live out my city life these days. So I’m going to recommend two other books focused on the mythology of this place: Truman Capote’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s (the book is very different than the movie) and M Train, Patti Smith’s memoir that begins in a cafe in the Village and expands as she thinks about life, loss, and family. –Corinne Segal, Senior Editor\n\nDaria C. loves:\nSylvia Plath, The Bell Jar\nVirginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway\nVladimir Nabokov, Lolita\nLit Hub recommends:\nOnly the best for you, Daria, eh? That’s my girl. I won’t lead you off the golden path. For a book that combines all of what I divine to be your literary interests—intense emotions, beautiful language, and a compelling, unique quality of mind—pick up Maggie Nelson’s Bluets, which is ostensibly a love letter to the color blue, but is so much more. It absolutely belongs on the above list of literary classics. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nErik M. loves:\nRobert Louis Stevenson, Treasure Island\nErik Larson, The Devil in the White City\nCormac McCarthy, Cities of the Plain\nLit Hub recommends: \nHardened men adventuring in lawless lands. Villains committing unspeakable acts. Evocative depictions of near-mystical places. You should check out The North Water, Ian McGuire’s 2016 novel (soon to be made into a miniseries starring Colin Farrell as the amoral Henry Drax) which Colm Toibin, in his New York Times review, referred to as being like “the result of an encounter between Joseph Conrad and Cormac McCarthy in some run-down port as they offer each other a long, sour nod of recognition.” It’s the story of a nineteenth-century whaling ship that sets sail for the Arctic with a tortured doctor and a vicious killer aboard. Fair warning: there are parts of this novel that are as brutal and graphic as anything in early McCarthy, but it’s a hell of a ride.  –Dan Sheehan, Book Marks editor\n\nMichael G. loves: \nNico Walker, Cherry\nWanted to know if you had any suggestions of books like this one (current crime world – almost documentary style realism).\nLit Hub recommends: \nIf you haven’t read it before, I’d recommend checking out Hard Rain Falling, by Don Carpenter, a moving and hard-boiled tale of surprising bonds formed during incarceration. I’d also recommend Meditations in Green, by Stephen Wright, a gorgeous meditation on the nature of trauma and addiction post-Vietnam. –Molly Odintz, CrimeReads Senior Editor\n\nDennis D. loves:\nItalo Calvino, If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler\nVladimir Nabokov, Pale Fire\nUmberto Eco, Foucault’s Pendulum\nEleanor Catton, The Luminaries\nMeg Elison, The Book of the Unnamed Midwife\nEmily St John Mandel, Station Eleven\nAnd\nSimenon\nAnd\nSjon\nLit Hub recommends:\nIf you haven’t read Wittgenstein’s Mistress, by David Markson, that is absolutely the book for you—postmodern, disjointed, philosophical, historical—but considering the moment, I’ll only truly recommend it if you’re the kind of person who wants to self-isolate while reading about the last woman on earth (maybe). To me, it’s the perfect book for the moment, and considering your love of Station Eleven, I bet you’ll agree. Otherwise, have you dug into Fernando Pessoa’s The Book of Disquiet? I think that may tickle your fancy too. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nAimee L. loves:\nRebecca Makkai, The Great Believers\nJohn Irving, A Prayer for Owen Meany\nJennifer Egan, A Visit from the Goon Squad\nLit Hub recommends: \nSprawling, big-hearted, kaleidoscopic, decades-spanning, heavily-peopled literary novels about America, eh? Well it sounds like you might enjoy Salvatore Scibona’s The Volunteer. Scibona’s lyrical, wildly ambitious second novel, published just last year, is the tale of four lost generations of American fathers and sons, and moves from 1950s Iowa, to 60s Vietnam, to 70s New York, and into the future.  –Dan Sheehan, Book Marks editor\n\nJacob W. loves:\nTim O’Brien, The Things They Carried\nKaren Russell’s short stories\nWilliam Faulkner, As I Lay Dying\nFyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment\nLit Hub recommends: \nKaren Russell is sort of the wild card in this list—but I take it your love of her work means that you’ll tolerate a little bit of the speculative in your serious (and sometimes Southern) literature. To you I recommend everything that Jesmyn Ward has ever written, but particularly her latest, Sing, Unburied, Sing, in which a road trip to prison is populated by more ghosts than expected. And speaking of ghosts, I’ll also mention Téa Obreht’s latest, Inland, which fits right in with your list of hardship and silver linings too. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nJill D. loves:\nJenny Offill, Weather\nJill Ciment, The Body in Question\nKevin Wilson, Nothing to See Here\nLit Hub recommends:\nAssuming that you’ve already read Dept. of Speculation (Jenny Offil’s first groundbreaking novel of a failing marriage told in beautiful, sometimes funny, fragments) your next step should be towards Aimee Bender’s The Girl in the Flammable Skirt. She and Jenny Offill share a similar dry wit. Plus, if you were drawn to the more fantastical side of Kevin Wilson’s novel, you will enjoy the surreal twists Aimee Bender puts on everyday mundanity. (Also, fire!) –Katie Yee, Book Marks Assistant Editor\n\nKristen J. loves:\nDavid Mitchell, Cloud Atlas\nPatrick deWitt, French Exit\nAmal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, This is How You Lose the Time War\nErik Larson, The Splendid and the Vile\nI love weird, but not scary or too violent. \nLit Hub recommends: \nI, too, am partial to the weird in fiction, Kristen, and perhaps my favorite weird novel (at least among those I’ve read in the last few years) is Katherine Dunn’s singular oddball masterpiece, Geek Love. The story of the Binewski siblings (a brood of genetically altered children who are bred to become the stars of their parents traveling carnival), it’s a grotesque, hypnotic, and at times hilarious tale of obsession, fanaticism, and familial love. –Dan Sheehan, Book Marks editor\n\nCarolyn F. loves:\nLing Ma, Severance\nEmil Ferris, My Favorite Thing is Monsters\nMadeleine L’Engle, A Wrinkle in Time\nLooking for something where the stakes feel urgent but not anxiety-inducing. A little magical realism, readable but not necessarily easy, and memorable.\nLit Hub recommends: \nFor a delightful bit of surreal mischief to hold in your hands, look no further than Kelly Link’s Magic for Beginners. These stories invigorate, infuse the everyday banality with a little otherworldly mysticism. (A trip to a Boston thrift shop amongst friends, for example, quickly becomes a search for a magical handbag that our hero’s ancestors got lost in—and that’s just the start!) Might I also recommend, depending on what you deem anxiety-inducing, a slender gem called Such Small Hands by Andrés Barba? It follows a young girl named Marina whose parents perish in a car crash and recounts her first days at the orphanage as she finds her place amongst the other girls there. There’s less actual magic, but the prose gives off a sinister, otherworldly feel that will haunt you in the best possible way. –Katie Yee, Book Marks Assistant Editor\n\nClaudia W. loves:\nJohn Wyndham, Day of the Triffids\nFyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov\nH. G. Wells, The Island of Doctor Moreau\nLit Hub recommends:\nI see you’re partial to the classics, and in particular those that question the nature of humanity through a science fiction lens. In that case, I recommend the great Stanisław Lem’s 1961 novel Solaris, translated from the Polish by Joanna Kilmartin, in which a psychologist visits a distant planet to investigate the mysterious—and possibly sentient, and definitely troublesome—sea that envelops it. Ignore the bad film—this is weird and wonderful stuff. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nLuke G. loves:\nDenis Johnson, Angels\nDon Carpenter, Hard Rain Falling\nCormac McCarthy, No Country for Old Men\nLit Hub recommends: \nGiven how few people seem to still remember Angels these days (Jesus’ Son still gets all the love), it’s almost required that I recommend you read Leonard Gardner’s Fat City, which was a major influence on Johnson’s debut—but judging from your list, I suspect you’ve already read it. If that’s the case, maybe take a look at Edward Bunker’s No Beast So Fierce, a gritty, semi-autobiographical novel in which an ex-con in L.A., newly out on parole, tries to go straight. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nErik K. loves:\nRecent book I read that I loved: Ted Chiang’s Stories of Your Life and Others\n3rd Favorite book ever: Thomas Wolfe’s Look Homeward, Angel\nI like stories about people who “leave it all behind”\nLit Hub recommends: \nI respect your decision to only tell us your third favorite book ever, but I have to admit I spent a long time wondering what the top two are. I’m also wondering if you’ve been hearing a lot about Ling Ma’s Severance, which tells the story of a woman working in publishing, in New York City, when a mysterious fever spreads rapidly, taking down the city and the rest of the world. Companies close, families flee, and our hero is left wandering the abandoned streets until she, too, (spoiler alert) leaves. About halfway through the book (my favorite part), we get a flashback to her childhood and her immigrant parents who left it all behind to come to America. Echoes of leaving and being left resound throughout the novel in a beautiful and propulsive way. –Katie Yee, Book Marks Assistant Editor\n\nStephanie H. loves:\nSamantha Hunt, The Dark Dark\nDenis Johnson, Jesus’ Son\nCharles Yu, How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe \nLit Hub recommends:\nMore people should read short stories, right? I know you feel me. One of my absolute favorite collections of the last decade—which really not enough people have read—is Diane Cook’s Man V. Nature, which will satisfy your urge for fabulist storytelling and tales that uncover the truth of human feeling. These are brilliant, evocative, and truly special stories—if you haven’t read them yet, I’m jealous that you get to experience them for the first time. And not for nothing, but “The Way the End of Days Should Be” seems like useful reading at the moment. P.S. if you like Man V. Nature, Cook’s first novel, The New Wilderness, comes out in August, and I can confirm it is also great.  –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nKristain M. loves:\nDurga Chew Bose, Too Much and Not the Mood\nJenny Slate, Little Weirds\nSally Rooney, Conversations with Friends\nLit Hub recommends:\nI was just reading Durga Chew Bose’s Too Much and Not the Mood—can we be friends? Can we book club Lindy West’s The Witches Are Coming, which is the collection that should be at the top of your TBR pile? From the voice behind the bestselling Shrill (which, yes, is also a Hulu series!) comes a series of bold (and often funny) essays on climate change, Grumpy Cat, dresses with pockets, and not being a white man in America. (Relatable.) –Katie Yee, Book Marks Assistant Editor\n\nTimothy P. loves:\nDino Buzzati, The Tartar Steppe\nThomas Bernhard, Woodcutters\nSiouxsie and the Banshees, Kaleidoscope\nLit Hub recommends: \nFor you, lover of synth, historical underpinnings, irreverence, and a healthy sense of the Kafkaesque, I recommend one of my favorite debuts from last year: Adam Ehrlich Sachs’ The Organs of Sense, which concerns a young Gottfried Leibniz and a blind astronomer. Semi-historical, semi-absurdist, semi-philosophical, wholly brilliant, definitely up your alley. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nToomas K. loves:\nMichael Cunningham, The Hours\nMikhail Bulgakov, The Master and Margarita\nSusanna Clarke, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\nAlso I like graphic novels, for example Locke&Key, Scott Pilgrim, and Blacksad\nLit Hub recommends:\nIt’s not exactly a one to one, but considering your interest in magic and the cleverly bombastic, I have a strong feeling you would enjoy Claire North’s The Gameshouse, a novel that takes the reader from 17th century Venice to 1930s Thailand to the present day all over the world, as its characters play games for the highest of stakes, with the most valuable of pieces. It has something of that graphic novel feel, too—at least in the sense that I can, months after reading it, see it all very clearly.  –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nToni W. loves:\nDonna Tartt, The Secret History\nMadeline Miller, Circe\nHanya Yanagihara, A Little Life\nLit Hub recommends: These books are fully-realized, self-contained worlds—obviously the best kind of escapism for the right now. I suggest you tuck into David Mitchell’s fantastical speculative fiction masterpiece Cloud Atlas, which is built of six fully-realized, interconnected worlds—all the better to lose reality just a little bit. –Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor\n\nSophia H. loves:\nJeffrey Eugenides, Middlesex\nAngela Carter, “Wolf Alice” (I know this is just a short story, but I think it’s perfect)\nSamanta Schweblin, Fever Dream\nMiriam Toews, All My Puny Sorrows\nLit Hub recommends:\nHere’s what I see in the tea leaves: an interest in twisted fairy tales, a tolerance for the surreal, a penchant for the epic, a soft spot for human struggles. With all that in mind, I must recommend one of my favorite novels, Duplex, by Kathryn Davis, a book which is very difficult to describe but deeply pleasing to read, if you’re possessed of a certain temperament—and I’m confident you are. Give it a shot and let me know what you think. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nSophia S. loves:\nJane Austen, Persuasion\nIan McEwan, Atonement\nHanya Yanagihara, A Little Life\nLit Hub recommends: \nI feel confident that you will love Kate Atkinson’s debut novel Behind the Scenes at the Museum—a brilliantly funny, heartrending novel that’s part bildungsroman, part family saga, and part mystery. It’s one of my all-time favorites. And if you love it, you should absolutely move on to Atkinson’s other excellent novels (though perhaps not Life After Life right this minute, unless you feel up for some rather vivid descriptions of the Spanish flu). –Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor\n\nSamantha L. loves:\nNeil Gaiman, Stardust\nKatherine Arden, The Bear and the Nightingale\nGail Carson Levine, Ella Enchanted \nLit Hub recommends:\nIf you’re willing to try something a little edgier but still fairy tale infused, I’d recommend getting into Helen Oyeyemi—I’d cosign anything she’s written, really, but my favorite is still Mr. Fox, which is based (loosely!) on the Bluebeard tale. And then once you’ve gobbled up all of the Oyeyemi, start in on Naomi Novik—her recent Spinning Silver is fantastic. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nNancy G. loves:\nDonna Tartt, The Goldfinch\nMichael Crummey, Sweetland\nKate Atkinson, Life After Life\nSusan Orlean, Orchid Thief \nLit Hub recommends: \nI’m getting a preference for sprawling, cinematic narratives with a hint of mystery. Excellent! My number one recommendation is The Corrections. I know, Jonathan Franzen not-unreasonably rubs some people the wrong way, but if you haven’t read The Corrections, it’s a genuinely great, tooth-sinkable novel that’s both propulsive and satisfyingly complex. It’s also surprisingly and darkly funny. I’d also check out Nathan Hill’s The Nix, for similar reasons: deft complexity, beautiful pacing, masterful plot. Both novels have the added treat of allowing you to escape into someone else’s (very dramatic) familial problems for a spell.  –Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor\n\nColin B. loves:\nGeorge Saunders\nCarmen Maria Machado, Her Body and Other Parties\nDenis Johnson, Largesse of the Sea Maiden. \nIf you’re sensing a pattern, I would enjoy anything that deals with tearing down the world as we know it right now, or humbles my over-inflated ego during this period of social distancing. White male authors not required at this time. \nLit Hub recommends: \nI am indeed sensing a pattern. If you haven’t picked it up yet, I recommend Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah’s excellent debut collection Friday Black, which should scratch your Saundersian (and world-destroying) itch. I also feel moved to recommend Akwaeke Emezi’s Freshwater, which could humble any reader who thinks they know all about what books are or what they can do. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nEvander C. loves:\nJosé Saramago, Blindness\nDan Simmons, The Terror\nH. P. Lovecraft, Shadow Out of Time\nLit Hub recommends: \nA trio of chilling literary tales you’ve aligned yourself with there, Evander. I think you might enjoy Ahmed Saadawi’s International Prize for Arabic Fiction-winning novel, Frankenstein in Baghdad. A contemporary take on the Frankenstein myth, set during the aftermath of the US invasion of the Iraqi capital, this novel (part horror, part disquieting political satire) tells the story of a junk-dealer named Hadi al-Attag who collects the scattered body parts of bomb victims, stitches them together, and inadvertently creates a grotesque creature, hell-bent on vengeance.  –Dan Sheehan, Book Marks editor\n\nOsama S. loves:\nAmitava Kumar, Immigrant, Montana\nRebecca Mead, My Life in Middlemarch\nKingsley Amis, Lucky Jim\nLit Hub recommends:\nI’m seeing a love for writers and their literary hijinks here. For you, I recommend Andrew Martin’s Early Work, in which a young writer tries (and basically fails) not to derail his whole life over an infatuation. It is very well written, and will make you cringe in a similar way to Lucky Jim. –Emily Temple, Senior Editor\n\nCurtis R. loves:\nUmberto Eco, The Name of the Rose\nIrvine Welsh, Trainspotting\nGillian Flynn, Sharp Objects\nStephen King, It\nClive Barker, The Damnation Game\nLit Hub recommends: \nNot only do I have one book recommendation for you, I have six (and counting): Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad series. To be honest, this is a recommendation tinged with envy, because now is the perfect time to tear through them all. Your affinity for Gillian Flynn suggests that you value tension and atmosphere, and French has both by the bucketful. While the series never approaches the pure horror of King, they share with It an interest in childhood fears and the role they play in shaping us. Besides all that, they’re beautifully written. –Jessie Gaynor, Social Media Editor \n\nCarlotta E. loves:\nMikhail Bulgakov, The Master and Margarita\nMark Greif, Against Everything\nAnna Burns, Milkman\nHere are three other things I love: \nbaking bread\nmy border terrier\nrunning\nLit Hub recommends:\nHmm. This is a tricky mix: the darkly carnal humor of Bulgakov, the kindhearted (and exasperated) erudition of Greif, the wry, fatalistic rhythms of Burns… set against the down-to-earth pleasures of bread, dogs, and running? This may sound weird, but I’m going to hazard Peter Carey’s virtuosic inhabitation of Aussie outlaw Ned Kelly, in True History of the Kelly Gang. Hell, it’s worth it alone for the unpunctuated first-person cadences of the main character (who most certainly eats bread, definitely runs, and likely crosses paths with a border terrier).  –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief\n \nMichael C. loves:\nCarson McCullers, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\nEM Forster, Howards End\nKurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse Five\nLit Hub recommends: \nAh, these are such bighearted books, filled with characters who (whether they admit it or not) so love the world it is almost unbearable to see their disappointment in it. So that’s why I’m recommending The Human Comedy by William Saroyan, which centers on 14-year-old boy just trying to get through WWII with his bighearted family in California’s Central Valley, waiting for dad to come home. The kid would have had a HUGE crush on Mick Kelly.   –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief\n\nBilbo P. loves:\nLucia Berlin, A Manual for Cleaning Women\nHugh Selby, Last Exit to Brooklyn\nLeonard Gardner, Fat City\n(I know Denis Johnson is reminiscent, so something else would be appreciated.) \nLit Hub recommends:\nThis one is easy: A Fan’s Notes, by Fred Exley. The writers you mention (who I love) each seemed to have one story to tell, and they kept telling it with varying levels of success. Exley also had one story to tell, and he told it only once, in this incredible autobiographical novel of football, failure, and getting by on the outskirts of America. (This is one of my favorite books.)  –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief\n\nDanielle B. loves:\nRichard Adams, Watership Down\nAlan Bradley, The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie\nRay Bradbury, Something Wicked this Way Comes\nLit Hub recommends:\nAh, I see you have a taste for the darkness dwelling down all the green and sunlit laneways of our rural imaginings! I haven’t read the Bradley, but for a wholly unique and tenebrous account of rural England—before it was even called England—might I recommend The Wake, by Paul Kingsnorth? Stylistically, it may be a reach for you—the 11th-century Albion patois takes some commitment to internalize—but its grim urgency and uncomfortable intimacy with the contours of the land itself align eerily with Watership Down.  –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief\n\nHaley J. loves:\nAll Kurt Vonnegut books but mainly Cat’s Cradle\nGeorges Perec, Life, a User’s Manual\nGeorge Saunders, Lincoln in the Bardo\nBeloved or anything else by Toni Morrison \nLit Hub recommends: \nFor me these books represent something like a radical moral canon: tenderness in the service of truth, anger aimed at injustice, comedy in aid of survival. These are serious books about serious times, creating entire worlds in which to live… so I’m going to recommend William T. Vollman’s Europe Central, a wildly ambitious (even for him!) novelization of the siege of Stalingrad in WWII, featuring the likes of Shostakovich and Akhmatova and a whole cast of poor, benighted souls lost in the bloodlands of far Eastern Europe.  –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief\n\nMary Jo A. loves:\nAnne Enright, The Gathering\nHelen DeWitt, The Last Samurai\nSebastian Barry, Days without End\nDavid Grossman, To the End of the Land\nPat Barker, Regeneration Trilogy\nLit Hub recommends: \nThe Last Samurai is probably the real outlier here, nested among these more conventional accounts of war and its inevitable tragedies, but I’m going to take it as a sign you’re up for anything. So I’m going to recommend Delia Falconer’s remarkable novel, The Lost Thoughts of Soldiers, which dials us in to the staticky daydreams of retired 7th Calvary general Frederick W. Benteen (a real person who had the great misfortune of surviving General Custer’s Battle of Little Bighorn) as he lives out his days in Atlanta drifting in and out of a ghost-filled past.  –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief\n\nAndreas D. loves:\nFyodor Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment\nGabriel García Márquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude\nOscar Wilde, The Portrait of Dorian Gray\nLit Hub recommends: \nIn the interest of balancing the dude energy here, and completing the dorm room full-house, I’m just going to advise you to read Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, and The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath.   –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief\n\nGary H. loves:\nAlfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality\nIris Murdoch, Metaphysics as a Guide to Morality\nRobert A. Heinlein, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\n(I’m not just being difficult, either—I’ve read all three multiple times. I took #1 with me to Tahiti for beach reading!)\nLit Hub recommends:  \nNot difficult at all! This is an easy one. The World As I Found It, by Bruce Duffy, is a great work of historical-philosophical fiction, following as it does the life and times of Ludwig Wittgenstein including, of course, his time at Cambridge where he may or may not have met Whitehead, but certainly did meet Murdoch once.   –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief\n\nJae K. loves:\nJane Bowles, Two Serious Ladies\nYoko Tawada trans. Margaret Mitsutani, The Bridegroom Was a Dog\nThe stories of Alice Munro\nLit Hub recommends: \nI am going to highly recommend the story collection  Here Until August by Josephine Rowe (who has, indeed, been called a millennial Alice Munro). A master of place and mood, Rowe tenderly deploys her characters across multiple continents, and though they never think of themselves as the main characters of their own lives, they somehow occupy center stage in the reader’s mind long after the book is done.  –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief\n\nTrevor F. loves:\nHenry Miller, Tropic of Cancer\nRoberto Bolaño, The Savage Detectives\nDavid Markson, Going Down\nI enjoy iconoclasm (I grew up very religious—spent 2 years as a Mormon missionary in Argentina), philosophical undertones, and big words. I read in English and Spanish.\nLit Hub recommends:\nBased on this list I’m going to assume you’ve probably already read The Power and the Glory, by Graham Greene, the story of disgraced priest on the run in Mexico in the 1930s? Real Going Down vibes. Maybe reread it? And though I haven’t read him in Spanish, I imagine the stark, existential clarity of Miguel de Unamuno is very similar to Camus’s flat style (which is very accessible in French for non-native speakers). Highly recommend.  –Jonny Diamond, Editor in Chief",

    "title": "5 Essential git Commands and Utilities",
    "description": "For many of us, git and GitHub play a huge role in our development workflows. Whenever we have a tool that we need to use often, the more fine-tuned we can make that tool, the faster we can get things done. The following are five git commands or helpers that can make your developer life much better!\n\n\n\nQuickly Pull Down Pull Requests\n\n\n\nReviewing code is as valuable or more valuable than writing your own code, as it benefits the coders around you. Instead of adding remotes, use this alias to quickly pull down pull requests:\n\n\n\ngit config --global --add alias.pr '!f() { git fetch -fu ${2:-upstream} refs/pull/$1/head:pr/$1 && git checkout pr/$1; }; f'\n\ngit config --global --add alias.pr-clean '!git checkout master ; git for-each-ref refs/heads/pr/* --format=\"%(refname)\" | while read ref ; do branch=${ref#refs/heads/} ; git branch -D $branch ; done'\n\n\n\n\n~/Projects/debugger.html (master) $ git pr 4862\nFrom https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html\n * [new ref]           refs/pull/4862/head -> pr/4862\nSwitched to branch 'pr/4862'\n\n\n\n\nThis is useful for reviewing both colleague and contributor pull requests!\n\n\n\nShow git Branch on Command Line\n\n\n\nMaking sure you’re on the desired git branch is critical, leading devs to typing git branch a million times a day.  With this trick, you can always have the branch name display in the command prompt:\n\n\n\n# Show current git branch in command line\nparse_git_branch() {\n     git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \\(.*\\)/ (\\1)/'\n}\nexport PS1=\"\\[\\033[32m\\]\\w\\[\\033[33m\\]\\$(parse_git_branch)\\[\\033[00m\\] $ \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a major qualify of developer life improvement!\n\n\n\ngit Branch Autocompletion\n\n\n\nI try to construct my branch names like {bug number}-some-description — it makes browsing of branches easy but makes typing them out cumbersome.  That’s why I set up git autocompletion:\n\n\n\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash\n\nif [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then\n  . ~/.git-completion.bash\nfi\n\n\n\n\nNow I can hit the tab key and the branch name will autocomplete!\n\n\n\nCreate Gists from Command Line\n\n\n\nOftentimes I’ll want to get a patch started for a contributor or simple use a few code changes to illustrate a point I’m trying to make.  With gist-diff, I can do that!\n\n\n\n# Install utility\nnpm install gist-diff\n\n# Send changes to GitHub to create dist\ngist-diff\n\n\n\n\nThis utility takes some minor setup but it’s worth it!\n\n\n\nDelete Merged Branches\n\n\n\nIf you like keeping your git branches well organized, here’s a fun script to purge branches that have been merged into master:\n\n\n\n[alias]\n  delete-merged-branches = \"!f() { git checkout --quiet master && git branch --merged | grep --invert-match '\\\\*' | xargs -n 1 git branch --delete; git checkout --quiet @{-1}; }; f\"\n\n\n\n\nVoila!  No more unnecessary branches cluttering your branch list!\n\n\n\nThese commands and utilities have made my git and development life much more enjoyable and proficient. Do you have any git tips you’d like to share! Please do so in the comments below!\nThe post 5 Essential git Commands and Utilities appeared first on David Walsh Blog.",

    "title": "How a French Midwife Solved a Public Health Crisis | JSTOR Daily",
    "description": "It was the 1700s, and France was facing a public health crisis: too many babies were dying in childbirth, especially in the countryside. A particularly panicky priest reported that he believed nearly 200,000 babies were dying each year. Leaders worried that they were headed toward depopulation. In 1735, the maternity ward of Paris’s oldest hospital, Hôtel Dieu, began providing three-month training workshops for midwives from the provinces. Alas, the program was not a success. Most women didn’t wish to travel that far and spend that much time away from their families.\nSo, the country’s problems with ill-trained midwives persisted. When a noble from the rural Auvergne region came to Paris declaring that he needed a midwife to come educate the region’s peasants in the art of delivery, one exceptionally experienced and entrepreneurial midwife heeded the call.  Seeing the horrific state of birth in Auvergne inspired du Coudray to transform childbirth education.  Angélique Marguerite Le Boursier du Coudray was head midwife at the Hôtel Dieu, where approximately 1,500 babies were born every year—sometimes a dozen a day. She had become a certified midwife after graduating from the College of Surgery and completing three years of apprenticeship. Thirty-six-year-old du Coudray had been practicing for eleven years when she headed to Auvergne, in 1751. Although she was unmarried, she took on the prefix “madame” to appear more conventional.\nAuvergne’s inhabitants were largely poor. They endured harsh winters, hot summers, and unproductive soil. For many country midwives, a speedy delivery was a good delivery. If things weren’t progressing quickly enough, they might tell the woman to jump up and down, or administer herbs to induce vomiting and diarrhea. Unsurprisingly, their methods resulted in many stillbirths and birth injuries. Du Coudray knew better:\nThe infinite calamities caused by ignorance in the countryside and which my profession has given me occasion to witness moved me to compassion and animated my zeal to procure more secure relief for humanity.\nSeeing the horrific state of birth in Auvergne inspired her to transform childbirth education. She crafted a life-sized birthing mannequin. Using dyed fabric, stuffing, leather, wood, wicker, and real pelvic bones, she built a model of the lower torso. She rigged up strings and straps to make the birth canal and perineum stretch, and installed sponges to spurt dyed liquids, simulating blood and amniotic fluid, at just the right moment. The stuffed newborn that emerged had a little nose, ears, mouth, and tongue, as well as ink-drawn hair, and was attached via a fabric umbilical cord. Du Coudray also crafted a set of twins attached to a placenta, a shriveled umbilical cord, a crushed infant head, and a fabric model of the reproductive system. To test her students’ knowledge, she numbered and identified each part with parchment. Du Coudray just called this contraption her “machine.” It cost roughly 300 livres (roughly $2,800 today) to construct. Such machines are sometimes called “obstetric phantoms.”\n“I perfected an invention that pity made me imagine,” du Coudray explained. “The advantages of this invention are immediately apparent.”\n* * *\nDu Coudray also wrote a textbook. Published in 1759, the Abrégé de l’art des accouchements (Abstract of the Art of Childbirth) was a practical, illustrated childbirth manual. It was a small, unfussy text, unengraved and cheaply produced. It was meant to be carried around in an apron and consulted frequently. Du Coudray’s mechanical view of childbirth is as apparent in her mannequin as it is in her textbook. As the science historian Londa Schiebinger wrote:\nWhen presented with a breech birth, she explained how she held the baby by the feet, pulling it out to the knee, then, taking firm hold, turned the baby so that its chin, once threatening to catch on the mother’s pubic bone, now pointed downward. She straightened the baby and brought down the arms; then going deep inside the mother with her hands, she slipped the finger of one hand inside the mouth while pushing down on the back of its head with the other to jar the baby loose.\nDu Coudray knew many of her students were illiterate, so she created her book in a way that could be understood whether or not you could read. The colorful images depict the mother’s pelvis and some associated soft tissues and the descending infant, presented as if you were looking through the skin and fat and seeing only the necessary bones and reproductive parts. Also illustrated are the midwife’s hands and how they should be positioned. After being trained by du Coudray and practicing on her machine, the illiterate midwife could consult the book’s illustrations as a reminder of what to do in a particular case. As Schiebinger noted:\nThese delicate maneuvers, the ability to visualize the interior of the mother’s body—the position and function of her organs and bones—the ability to manipulate the baby without damage, to know how and when to administer herbal remedies, all had to be packaged in a way that could be taught quickly to illiterate female students in the countryside.\nThe book follows the same order as du Coudray’s lectures. First, reproductive organs and the reproductive process are explained. Next, prenatal care. Then, the bulk of the text is spent on deliveries. Du Coudray’s pedagogy attempts to prepare her pupils to handle every eventuality. Common malpresentations of the baby are covered, such as breech (feet-first), knee-first, stomach-first, or arm-first. Delivery of twins or a stillborn are also discussed. Finally, du Coudray outlines rare complications she’s encountered. Of her “little work,” du Coudray stated, “I was determined to make it simple; I have assembled in it all that is most essential in this art, and most accessible to those least schooled in this matter.”\nThe machine of Madame du Coudray via Flickr\nThe magistrate of Auvergne asked her to craft a machine for each of the most populous cities in his region. A surgeon from each city came to study the inner workings of the machine with du Coudray for fifteen days, then took it back with them. These surgeons would in turn train their local midwives in her methods. When the Academy of Surgery heard about her machine, they asked her to bring it in for assessment. Because of its accuracy and detail, it was awarded a seal of approval as a childbirth education tool. “This was a rare honor—even more so for a woman,” noted the midwife and medical historian Scottie Hale Buehler, and “approval of du Coudray’s mannequin was no small feat for the midwife.”\nDu Coudray translated her success in Auvergne into an advertisement. She penned a letter to a cadre of the king’s men touting her machine, textbook, and transformational teaching method. She claimed that after three months of lessons, even women without “the remotest knowledge of childbirth” could be sufficiently trained. Other courses on childbirth only taught theory, and only prepared midwives for normal births, she explained, so any complications would catch them off guard. Those blind spots greatly increased the likelihood that such complications would prove deadly for mom and baby. Du Coudray wrote:\nYoung surgeons and women, rushing to benefit from a profession they know only superficially, spill out all over the countryside. But when difficulties arise, they are absolutely unskilled, and until long experience instructs them, they are the witness or the cause of many misfortunes.\nMisfortunes included lost lives, babies deformed or disabled, and young mothers rendered infertile. She asserted that “one learns on the machine in little time how to prevent such accidents.”\nShe was a crafty businessperson who knew her audience. She stressed the importance of her work as a patriotic necessity that protected the country’s most precious commodity: its future citizens and soldiers. The king would do well to employ her expertise across the entire country, she reasoned.\nHer pitch worked. King Louis XV commissioned her to take her training all over France. From 1760 to 1783, du Coudray criss-crossed the nation, teaching midwives how to deliver babies. Most cities paid her 300 livres a month for her teaching. Students were never charged for the training. She was also given lavish gifts, which she interprets as emblems of her success. Across her tenure, du Coudray taught upwards of 10,000 students. When all was said and done, she and the surgeon-demonstrators who carried on her work had trained two-thirds of France’s midwives.\n* * *\nNot everyone was pleased by du Coudray’s activities. In his hefty text, Precis de doctrine sur l’art d’accoucher (Precise Doctrine on the Art of Childbirth), the Parisian surgeon and accoucheur (male midwife) Jean Le Bas declared du Coudray’s machine a woefully inadequate teaching tool: “the best executed mannequin is only a ghost, an enactment, a shadow of truth, capable of giving false ideas to the beginners who, once having their heads filled, would not know to avoid the practice of a bad job on a living subject.”\nLe Bas worried such practice would give students a false sense of security that would quickly disappear when presented with a real live woman in labor. Her passive stuffed mannequin bears too little resemblance to a living, breathing, pain-wracked body. One could only truly learn from experience observing and assisting actual bodies in labor.\nBuehler, the medical historian, draws attention to how Le Bas’s choice of words “phantom, simulacrum, and shadow of truth (phantôme, simulacre, ombre du vrai) exposes his belief in the lack of transferability of skills learned on the machine to a woman in labor.”\nOne anonymous citizen wrote to defend the woman “who trains midwives all over the Kingdom on behalf of the King” from such attacks. Of the machine, this citizen noted: “This innocent artifice succeeded for du Coudray to make the students repeat the maneuvers; these good women were encouraged and succeeded perfectly.”\nA handful of towns, mostly across the south of France, turned her away. In some areas, the town midwife was an experienced, revered member of the community. It was insulting for them to be lumped in with the ill-qualified practitioners, characterized as backwoods numpties. Others were simply turned off by her puffed-up self-importance and brazen self-promotion.  Just a few years after du Coudray graduated, surgeons tried to eliminate midwives by barring them from attending the University of Paris’s school of surgery.  Long before she rose to national prominence, du Coudray helped ensure Parisian midwives got proper training. Female midwives had long been in charge of uncomplicated births, with surgeons called in for emergencies or difficult births. But men increasingly wanted dominion over all births. Just a few years after du Coudray graduated, surgeons tried to eliminate midwives by barring them from attending the University of Paris’s school of surgery. Without a credentialing exam, unlicensed, and occasionally untrained, midwives took to setting up shop anyway. Du Coudray, along with 39 other midwives, signed a petition demanding that the medical faculty provide instruction in reproductive anatomy to midwives. The University conceded.\nIn other words, it wasn’t just life-saving training that du Coudray gave France; she also demonstrated the indispensability of midwives. Thanks to the rise of obstetric forceps in the mid-1700s, surgeons were raving about the potential of this tool to transform childbirth and render midwives superfluous. Midwives were subordinate members of the surgeons’ guild, subject to their policing and lacking a recognized group of their own. A 1755 parliamentary resolution ruled that midwives were not allowed to wield forceps, only surgeons. But du Coudray was determined that her methods would render forceps superfluous.\nShe died in 1794. Thanks to gaps in the historical record, it took the science historian Nina Rattner Gelbart a decade to write the only existing biography of du Coudray. And only one du Coudray machine survived. Writing in the literary magazine Prairie Schooner, the poet Leslie Adrienne Miller described encountering it for the first time:\n\nI gasp out loud\nwhen I find Le Boursier’s soft machine\nof linen and leather, the woman’s thighs\ngreat hams of rosy fabric gathered at the knees like parlor bolsters,\nthe plush swell of belly draped\nin a modest apron opened in a V,\nthat all who would deliver her\nmight see the fine embroidery\nof the wrinkled vulva giving way\nto the crowning cloth doll, one puffed\numbilical cord to announce life,\n\nanother flat to advertise a death.\n\nIt resides at the Flaubert Museum of the History of Medicine, in Rouen, France, a reminder of Du Coudray’s transformative work.",

    "title": "Author Ernest Hemingway Quarantined with his Wife and Mistress",
    "description": "Last week, a letter supposedly written by F. Scott Fitzgerald—quarantined due to the Spanish Flu in 1920—made the social media rounds. In it, Fitzgerald states that he and Zelda had fully stocked their bar, and called Hemingway a flu “denier” who refused to wash his hands. This letter went viral.\nThe only problem? It was not written by Fitzgerald; its true author is Nick Farriella, who had written it as a parody for McSweeney’s earlier this month. However, for those of you who crave an actual Lost Generation quarantine story, you’re in luck. Please allow me to entertain you with the true story of how Ernest Hemingway was once quarantined not only with his wife and sick toddler, but also his mistress. He actually took quite nicely to it.\n      \nIn the summer of 1926, Hemingway was still married to his first wife, Hadley Hemingway, and they had a three-year-old son Jack, whom they called Bumby. Hemingway and Hadley had arrived in Paris a few years earlier so Hemingway could pursue his dream of becoming a world-famous, groundbreaking writer. That summer he was on the brink of a breakthrough, accumulating the lifestyle trappings he felt a celebrity author must have—including a fashionable mistress, Pauline Pfeiffer.\nWhereas Hadley was church-mouse–poor, Pauline was an heiress; while Hadley was homely and docile, Pauline was a sleek Vogue editor with a commanding personality. When Hadley had, just weeks earlier, learned of the affair and confronted Hemingway about it, he had grown furious and told her that she was the true offender. He raged that everything would have been just fine if she hadn’t dragged the situation into the open.\nThe couple decided to carry on, but it became clear that Hemingway had no intention of giving up Pauline; nor did his mistress intend to bow out. Rather, she made herself omnipresent. It was just going to take Hadley a while to get used to her new normal.\nHemingway went on to Madrid to attend the bullfights, and Hadley took Bumby to Cap d’Antibes to stay with their wealthy friends Sara and Gerald Murphy in the now-legendary Villa America. The home was a Riviera paradise, perched on top of terraced lawns and orchards above the Mediterranean. \n                Bumby had a cough when he arrived from Paris; it worsened when he and Hadley arrived in Cap d’Antibes. Watching the little boy play with their three children on the beach, the Murphys grew anxious and summoned their doctor, who came to Villa America to examine Bumby. His diagnosis: whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory illness that induces violent, uncontrollable coughing fits.\n      \nOn medical orders, the Murphys immediately exiled Hadley and Bumby from Villa America. Luckily, F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda—who were also summering in Antibes—had a lease on a small house nearby and offered it as a quarantine shelter to them. Gerald Murphy wrote to Hemingway in Madrid, trying to put a good face on the situation: Hadley would probably be far happier not having to listen to the shrieks of so many kids, he contended, and Bumby was under the care of a superlative English doctor and eating fresh vegetables from the garden. Hemingway was not to worry; everything was under control. \nBumby’s nanny hustled down from Paris to the Riviera where she, Hadley, and Bumby settled into an isolated sickroom routine. The Murphys and Fitzgeralds kept “a grand distance from us poisonous ones,” Hadley reported to Hemingway, although both families sent them provisions. Loneliness and uncertainty tormented Hadley, although a walk into town and a shot of whisky helped alleviate her unhappiness and stress. \n      \nSoon, however, company arrived that made Hadley long for solitude again. “Pfeiffer is stopping off here Wednesday,” Hadley informed Hemingway in a letter.\nHadley later stated that she was bemused by Pfeiffer’s sudden appearance, even claiming to one biographer that Hemingway had likely implored Pfeiffer—who’d had whooping cough as a child and was immune—to go to Hadley and help alleviate the family’s isolation. But in reality, on May 21, Hadley wrote Hemingway and told him that she’d invited Pfeiffer “to stop off here if she wants,” adding that it would be a “swell joke on tout le monde if you and Fife and I spent the summer [together]” on the Riviera. She appeared to be making light of the tricky romantic situation. In any case, Pfeiffer moved into the house. \nSoon Hemingway joined them, setting the stage for what must have been one of the odder and more claustrophobic households in literary history. The idea of sharing a two-bedroom house with his mistress, an angry wife, a contagious, sick toddler, and a hovering nanny might have brought a lesser man to his knees, but Hemingway later described the setting as “a splendid place to write.”\n      \nThe Murphys and the Fitzgeralds did what they could to keep up the morale at the Hemingway-Pfeiffer homestead. In the early evenings at cocktail hour, they would park their cars on the road in front of the house have a drink by the fence lining the small front yard. Hemingway, Hadley, and Pfeiffer held up their end of the party from the veranda.\nThey were indeed social distancing pioneers, and it gave the Fitzgeralds and Murphys front-row seats to the drama of the Hemingways’ unconventional new arrangement—their “domestic difficulties,” as Zelda put it. At the end of each evening, the group mounted their empty bottles upside down on the fence spikes. By the time the Hemingways and Pfeiffer left a few weeks later, these trophies ran the entire length of the fence.\n      \nThe quarantine worked: Bumby healed, and apparently no one else fell ill. After a few weeks, the trio moved their headquarters to a nearby hotel, where they stashed Bumby and his nanny in a little house on the grounds to continue his convalescence. \nPfeiffer remained ubiquitous—“everything was done a trois,” Hadley later recalled. Even now that they were all out of strict quarantine, Pfeiffer even crawled into the Hemingways’ bed in the morning to share their breakfast. Hadley also later recalled that Pauline insisted on giving her a diving lesson that almost killed her.\nAfter Pfeiffer went back to Paris, she peppered the Hemingways with letters, including one that brazenly stated, “I am going to get everything I want.”\nNot surprisingly, the Hemingway marriage did not last the summer. They had survived whooping cough and quarantine, but the onslaught of Miss Pauline Pfeiffer proved fatal.\n      \nThis story was partly adapted from Lesley Blume’s book Everybody Behaves Badly: The True Story Behind Hemingway’s Masterpiece The Sun Also Rises. Her next book, Fallout: The Hiroshima Cover-up and the Reporter Who Revealed It to the World, will be released summer 2020.",

    "title": "The Crisis Could Last 18 Months. Be Prepared.",
    "description": "Get your battle rhythm, I keep telling myself, as I put on my oversize sweatpants for the third day in a row. Staying inside, away from our offices, routines, and community, feels jarring even for those who, on a rational level, understand the need for extreme social distancing. The good side is having more family time. But everything seems upended, even to homeland-security professionals who argued for upending everything to slow the spread of COVID-19.Just as seasickness abates once you can see the shore, the disruptions that the country is now experiencing would be easier to manage if we knew they would end soon. The community-isolation effort happened remarkably fast—within days, whole communities all but closed down, and earlier this week the federal government finally recommended the same. On Thursday, Governor Gavin Newsom ordered the entire state of California to stay home “until further notice.” But the way the crisis ends will be far more muddled. There isn’t going to be one all-clear signal—and certainly not one anytime soon.[Read: What you need to know about the coronavirus]As the days and weeks in isolation go by, and the shock of What just happened? turns to Family time is overrated, people will become more insistent on knowing two things: When will the pandemic end? And when can we go back to normal? Those questions have different answers, and the answer to the latter—far from being a purely scientific decision—will be guided by ice-cold moral and political calculations that nobody wants to discuss out loud.From a public-health standard, the pandemic will not end for another 18 months. The only complete resolution—a vaccine—could be at least that far away. The development of a successful vaccine is both difficult and not sufficient. It must also be manufactured, distributed, and administered to a nation’s citizens. Until that happens, as recent reports from the U.S. government and from scientists at London’s Imperial College point out, we will be vulnerable to subsequent waves of the new coronavirus even if the current wave happens to ebb.None of which means that people now hunkered down at home will keep doing so through late 2021. The economic consequences of an indefinite lockdown are unsustainable. And at a certain point, the emotional tensions that staying home imposes upon families, as spouses grate upon each other and children get bored and fall behind on their schoolwork, become a danger to domestic harmony, and maybe even to everyone’s sanity.At the moment, we are just playing for time. Whether social distancing is working will be clearer in a month than it is now, but even then we will not know to a moral certainty when adults can safely go back to the office and children can go back to school. Which is partly why employers, university officials, and others have given such widely varying time frames for how long they are shutting things down—two weeks, until the end of April, until the end of the academic year, until sometime later.Two weeks, for what it’s worth, is just a way of breaking the bad news easily. If anything, we are likely to see more draconian distancing measures if the data start to show success. The goal of social distancing, as everyone now knows, is to “flatten the curve”—to keep the number of COVID-19 cases from spiking faster than the medical system can mobilize to handle them. But a flatter curve is longer; a failure of social distancing would mean the peak comes sooner—at a horrifying cost of lives—but also that Americans are back outside sooner.If entirely suppressing the coronavirus is a public-health ideal, crisis management is the homeland-security standard. The goal is to minimize risk, maximize defenses, and maintain social cohesion at the same time. In a society that must start moving again at some point, emergency-management planners looking at the metrics may seem heartless.[Read: Why the coronavirus has been so successful]In the military, commanders must make calculations about acceptable losses; the benefits of a mission have to be weighed against the certainty that some soldiers will be lost. We don’t have such language in the homeland-security world, but trade-offs are still inevitable. The wrenching decision to open up again—to accept more exposures to the coronavirus as the price of an earlier economic revival—is simply a judgment call. It is too late to prevent tragedy entirely; our goal is to manage it within the limits of scientific progress and public tolerance.In the weeks to come, we should see a surge not only of patients, but also of supplies. The federal government has two main jobs right now: to get testing kits distributed nationwide, and to quicken the flow of money and expertise to support state and local efforts and expand the capacity of the health system. Go big or go home—the classic warning against half measures—is an old emergency-management maxim, and current circumstances give it an ironic twist: Because Americans are at home, the federal government needs to go big.Managing the pandemic well doesn’t mean eradication; it means that our ability to mitigate how many people die—our ability to isolate those sick, test their contacts, care for them in available intensive-care beds with available respirators—is working. Social distancing, currently our primary tool to manage the burdens on our health-care system, will eventually give way to efforts to quickly identify those infected, before they can expose others, and also to treat those already exposed. Even before a vaccine is available, the United States will fall into a steady-state suppression effort—which is to say, life will go on, even as public-health officials play whack-a-mole with individual outbreaks.So, that’s the plan. Sometime between now and when a vaccine becomes available, restaurants and schools and offices will reopen. It won’t happen all at once, as if by official decree, but as individual households and workplaces conclude one by one that they’ve had enough—and that the surge in testing kits, intensive-care beds, and other resources is finally sufficient to meet the need. That won’t take a year and a half. But I expect to be in these sweats for at least another month—and I’m planning for two.",

    "title": "The 15th Anniversary of Doing Kottke.org as a Full-Time Job",
    "description": "Fifteen years ago this week, on Feb 22, 2005, I announced that I was going to turn kottke.org, my personal website, into my full-time job.\n\n\nI recently quit my web design gig and — as of today — will be working on kottke.org as my full-time job. And I need your help.\n\nI’m asking the regular readers of kottke.org (that’s you!) to become micropatrons of kottke.org by contributing a moderate sum of money to help enable me to edit/write/design/code the site for one year on a full-time basis.\n\n\nIt seemed like madness at the time — I’d quit my web design job a few months earlier in preparation, pro blogs existed (Gawker was on its 3rd editor) but very few were personal, general, and non-topical like mine, and I was attempting to fund it via a then-largely-unproven method: crowdfunding. As I wrote on Twitter the other day, attempting this is “still the most bonkers I-don’t-know-if-this-is-going-to-work thing I’ve ever done”.\n\nThese days, people are used to paying directly for online media through services like Kickstarter, Patreon, and Substack and kids want to run their own personality-driven businesses online when they grow up. But back then, aside from the likes of the WSJ, websites were either a) free to read or b) free to read & supported by advertising and being an online personality was not a lucrative thing. But I figured that enough of you would pitch in to support the site directly while keeping it free to read for everyone with no advertising.\n\nIn order to make it feel somewhat familiar, I patterned it after a PBS/NPR fund drive. During a three-week kick-off period, I asked people to support the site by becoming micropatrons. The suggested donation was $30 (but people could give any amount) and there were thank you gifts — like signed books, software, signed photo prints, a free SXSW ticket — for people who contributed. Several hundred people ended up contributing during those three weeks, enough for me to do the site for a year. I still remember that first day, responding to well-wishes from friends on AIM and watching my PayPal account fill up, and it hitting me that this bonkers scheme was actually going to work and pretty much bursting into tears.\n\nFast forward to the present day and this little website is still chugging along. In its almost 22 years of existence, kottke.org has never gotten big, but it’s also never gone away, predating & outlasting many excellent and dearly missed sites like Grantland, Rookie, The Toast, The Awl, Gawker, and hundreds of others. I have other people write for the site on occasion, but it’s still very much a one-person production by a reluctant influencer (*barf*) who, as an introvert, still (naively?) thinks about posts on the site as personal emails to individual readers rather than as some sort of broadcast. I’d like to thank those early supporters for having faith in me and in this site — you’re the reason we’re all still here, gathered around this little online campfire, swapping stories about the human condition.\n\nAbout 3 years ago, I returned to the crowdfunding model with kottke.org’s membership program. Since then, I’m very happy to report, readers like you who have purchased memberships have become the main source of financial support for the site. As I’ve written before, I have come to love the directness of this approach — I write, you pay, no middlemen, and, crucially, the site remains part of the Open Web, unpaywalled & free for everyone to read. If you’ll indulge me in a request on this anniversary, if you’re not currently a member of the site (or if your membership has lapsed) and can afford to do so, please consider supporting the site with a membership today. I really appreciate everyone who has become a member over the past few years — thank you!! — and I hope you will consider joining them.\n\nNote: I have no photos of myself taken around this time in 2005, so the photo at the top of the post is me circa spring 1996. I’d dropped out of grad school & was back living at my dad’s house, spending 10-12 hours a day online (via a 28.8K modem) trying to figure out how to build websites. I applied for jobs & internships at places like Wired/Hotwired, Razorfish, Studio Archetype, and MTV but no one wanted to hire a physics major w/ no art or design education or experience to design websites. kottke.org was still a couple of years off at this point…\n\n Tags: Jason Kottke   kottke.org   webdev",

    "title": "Wikipedia Is the Last Best Place on the Internet",
    "description": "The site's innovations have always been cultural rather than computational. It was created using existing technology. This remains the single most underestimated and misunderstood aspect of the project: its emotional architecture. Wikipedia is built on the personal interests and idiosyncrasies of its contributors; in fact, without getting gooey, you could even say it is built on love. Editors' passions can drive the site deep into inconsequential territory—exhaustive detailing of dozens of different kinds of embroidery software, lists dedicated to bespectacled baseball players, a brief but moving biographical sketch of Khanzir, the only pig in Afghanistan. No knowledge is truly useless, but at its best, Wikipedia weds this ranging interest to the kind of pertinence where Larry David's “Pretty, pretty good!” is given as an example of rhetorical epizeuxis. At these moments, it can feel like one of the few parts of the internet that is improving.\nOne challenge in seeing Wikipedia clearly is that the favored point of comparison for the site is still, in 2020, Encyclopedia Britannica. Not even the online Britannica, which is still kicking, but the print version, which ceased publication in 2012. If you encountered the words Encyclopedia Britannica recently, they were likely in a discussion about Wikipedia. But when did you last see a physical copy of these books? After months of reading about Wikipedia, which meant reading about Britannica, I finally saw the paper encyclopedia in person. It was on the sidewalk, being thrown away. The 24 burgundy-bound volumes had been stacked with care, looking regal before their garbage-truck funeral. If bought new in 1965, each of them would have cost $10.50—the equivalent of $85, adjusted for inflation. Today, they are so unsalable that thrift stores refuse them as donations.\nWikipedia and Britannica do, at least, share a certain lineage. The idea of building a complete compendium of human knowledge has existed for centuries, and there was always talk of finding some better substrate than paper: H. G. Wells thought microfilm might be the key to building what he called the “World Brain”; Thomas Edison bet on wafer-thin slices of nickel. But for most people who were alive in the earliest days of the internet, an encyclopedia was a book, plain and simple. Back then, it made sense to pit Wikipedia and Britannica against each other. It made sense to highlight Britannica's strengths—its rigorous editing and fact-checking procedures; its roster of illustrious contributors, including three US presidents and a host of Nobel laureates, Academy Award winners, novelists, and inventors—and to question whether amateurs on the internet could create a product even half as good. Wikipedia was an unknown quantity; the name for what it did, crowdsourcing, didn't even exist until 2005, when two WIRED editors coined the word.\nWikipedia is built on the personal interests and idiosyncrasies of its contributors. You could even say it is built on love.That same year, the journal Nature released the first major head-to-head comparison study. It revealed that, for articles on science, at least, the two resources were nearly comparable: Britannica averaged three minor mistakes per entry, while Wikipedia averaged four. (Britannica claimed “almost everything about the journal's investigation … was wrong and misleading,” but Nature stuck by its findings.) Nine years later, a working paper from Harvard Business School found that Wikipedia was more left-leaning than Britannica—mostly because the articles tended to be longer and so were likelier to contain partisan “code words.” But the bias came out in the wash. The more revisions a Wikipedia article had, the more neutral it became. On a “per-word basis,” the researchers wrote, the political bent “hardly differs.”\nBut some important differences don't readily show up in quantitative, side-by-side comparisons. For instance, there's the fact that people tend to read Wikipedia daily, whereas Britannica had the quality of fine china, as much a display object as a reference work. The edition I encountered by the roadside was in suspiciously good shape. Although the covers were a little wilted, the spines were uncracked and the pages immaculate—telltale signs of 50 years of infrequent use. And as I learned when I retrieved as many volumes as I could carry home, the contents are an antidote for anyone waxing nostalgic.\nI found the articles in my '65 Britannica mostly high quality and high minded, but the tone of breezy acumen could become imprecise. The section on Brazil's education system, for instance, says it is “good or bad depending on which statistics one takes and how they are interpreted.” Almost all the articles are authored by white men, and some were already 30 years out of date when they were published. Noting this half-life in 1974, the critic Peter Prescott wrote that “encyclopedias are like loaves of bread: the sooner used, the better, for they are growing stale before they even reach the shelf.” The Britannica editors took half a century to get on board with cinema; in the 1965 edition, there is no entry on Luis Buñuel, one of the fathers of modern film. You can pretty much forget about television. Lord Byron, meanwhile, commands four whole pages. (This conservative tendency wasn't limited to Britannica. Growing up, I remember reading the entry on dating in a hand-me-down World Book and being baffled by its emphasis on sharing milkshakes.)\nThe worthies who wrote these entries, moreover, didn't come cheap. According to an article in The Atlantic from 1974, Britannica contributors earned 10 cents per word, on average—about 50 cents in today's money. Sometimes they got a full encyclopedia set as a bonus. They apparently didn't show much gratitude for this compensation; the editors complained of missed deadlines, petulant behavior, lazy mistakes, and outright bias. “People in the arts all fancy themselves good writers, and they gave us the most difficult time,” one editor told The Atlantic. At Britannica rates, the English-language version of Wikipedia would cost $1.75 billion to produce.\nThere was another seldom remembered limitation to these gospel tomes: They were, in a way, shrinking. The total length of paper encyclopedias remained relatively finite, but the number of facts in the universe kept growing, leading to attrition and abbreviation. It was a zero-sum game in which adding new articles meant deleting or curtailing incumbent information. Even the most noteworthy were not immune; between 1965 and 1989, Bach's Britannica entry shrank by two pages.\nBy the time the internet came into being, a limitless encyclopedia was not just a natural idea but an obvious one. Yet there was still a sense—even among the pioneers of the web—that, although the substrate was new, the top-down, expert-driven Britannica model should remain in place.",

    "title": "An Officer And A Diplomat: The Strange Case Of The GRU Spy With A Red Notice",
    "description": "In its original series of investigations in 2018, Bellingcat identified three GRU officers: Maj. Gen. Denis Sergeev, Col. Anatoliy Chepiga and  Col. Alexander Mishkin, M.D., linked to the March 2018 Novichok poisonings in Salisbury.\nIn several follow-up reports, Bellingcat and its investigative partner The Insider disclosed the existence of a clandestine GRU team earmarked and trained for overseas disruptive operations and extraterritorial assassinations. This elite team is disguised as part of a larger GRU training unit referred to Military Unit 29155.\nIn a report from 7 July 2019, we tracked the frequent travels of officers from this GRU team to Switzerland in the period 2016-2018, with an especially high concentration of concurrent trips to the area near Lake Geneva at the end of 2017 and early 2018.\nIn two further investigations from 2019, we disclosed the link between this GRU unit and two poisoning attempts targeting Emilian Gebrev, a Bulgarian weapons manufacturer, his son, and his business associate in April and May 2018. We identified eight different GRU officers who had visited Bulgaria undercover in the months immediately preceding the poisoning, with three of these being in Bulgaria during each of the attempts.\nOn 23 January 2020, Bulgarian prosecutors announced indictments and issued Interpol wanted alerts against three of the GRU officers previously identified by Bellingcat. Authorities also released surveillance footage showing one of them wearing a disguise and approaching several cars in an underground garage where the poison victims’ cars had been parked.\n\nIn this investigation conducted jointly with our partners Tamedia (Switzerland) and The Insider (Russia), we identify a key member of the recently indicted trio who, following the two failed assassination attempts in Bulgaria in 2015, was accredited to a diplomatic post under his real name in Switzerland. From his new base in Geneva, he continued to work for GRU under diplomatic cover, likely assisted various secret service operations in Switzerland, and may have taken part in the preparation of the Skripal poisoning. \nAs he was accredited by Russia through the end of 2020, this marks the first known case when a Russian diplomat is simultaneously wanted for attempted murder under an Interpol Red Notice. This GRU officer departed Geneva urgently midway through his four-year mandate following Bellingcat’s disclosures and identifications of members of this GRU unit published in late 2018.\nHe traveled and worked undercover in the period 2008-2015 under the assumed name of Georgy Aleksandrovich Gorshkov, born 1977. In fact, his real name, under which he was accredited to the World Trade Organization in Geneva, is Egor Aleksandrovich Gordienko, born 1979.\nWhat We Know About Gordienko\nEgor Gordienko was born in 1979 in Bolgrad, a small town near Odessa, where his father, a military unit commander, had been stationed as part of the 98th Airborne Assault Division. His family hails from Tyumen, a city in Western Siberia. At some point in the early 80’s, his father was relocated to Moscow and his family moved with him.\n\nUndated older passport photo of Egor Gordienko. Right: Gordienko’s old apartment building and playground in the military town he grew up (photo credit: father’s VK page)\n\nWe have not been able to find out where Egor Gordienko’s received his early education, but based on the credentials of other members of the clandestine GRU unit, it is not unlikely that after receiving his schooling he graduated from the GRU Academy in Moscow. His first international trip was in January 2007, was conducted under his real name, Gordienko, and involved a 12-day stay in Cairo. While domestic travel records indicate that at this time he was already working for the GRU, his undercover identity had not yet been created. Based on the oldest undercover identity document we have discovered so far, the clandestine undercover team within Unit 29155 was created in its current form in 2009.\nGordienko’s first trip under his cover identity , as “Georgy Gorshkov”, a made-up persona two years older than his real age, was in September 2010 when he traveled to Barcelona, Spain. During the remainder of 2010, he managed to take trips in quick succession to Finland, Ukraine, and Turkey. In 2011 and 2012, he only traveled to Ukraine and Turkey.\nIn 2013, “Gorshkov” also visited Ukraine and Turkey, but also made two trips to Tajikistan, both times with other members of the clandestine team, which included “Sergey Fedotov”, i.e. the cover name for Denis Sergeev.\nIn February 2014, Gordienko traveled to Prague, and during July, October and November he made three long trips to Switzerland, France, and Italy, staying in the region for 45 days in the last quarter of that year.\nDuring early 2014, Gordienko also made trips to Krasnodar and Crimea. Based on the pattern of his trips to Ukraine on the eve of the annexation of Crimea, and the known involvement of the clandestine GRU team in the annexation, we assume he also took part in that operation. Notably, in July 2014, Gordienko’s family was granted an upscale apartment in the same Moscow building where Alexander Mishkin and Vladimir Moiseev also received apartments at the same time. Based on the timing and lack of evidence of payment for these apartments, we assume that they were gifted to (certain) members of the clandestine team as an incentive in addition to a governmental award. As Mishkin and Chepiga received their apartments as part of the bestowal of the “Hero of Russia” award over their role in the Crimea annexation, it is logical to assume the same holds true for Egor Gordienko.\nBulgarian Operation\nOn 11 February 2015, “Gorshkov” flew from Moscow to Sofia. Nine days later, he returned to Moscow, taking a flight from neighboring Greece. Bulgarian investigators assume that this was a reconnaissance trip in preparation for the assassination attempt on Emilian Gebrev. As we wrote previously, a number of other members of the same GRU team made “staggered” trips to Bulgaria in the first months of 2015, also likely as part of the operation’s preparatory phase.\nOn 24 April 2015, “Gorshkov” flew back from Moscow to Bulgaria, this time landing in the seaside resort of Burgas. Two other members of the team- “Sergey Fedotov” (Denis Sergeev) and “Sergey Pavlov” (Sergey Lyutenko) – flew in on or around the same day. The three rented a car and moved on to the capital Sofia, where, according to Bulgarian prosecutors, they stayed at the Hill Hotel, and expressly requested rooms with a view to the entrance of an underground garage to the side of the hotel. This was the garage used by Emilian Gebrev’s company, Emco.\nAt 13:57 on 28 April, one of the three — who is thought to be the senior-most team member, Denis Sergeev — can be seen in a wide-brim hat, shades, and gloves moving among cars in Emco’s underground garage and presumably spraying the targets’ car door-handles with a yet unidentified organophosphate poison.\n\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cOtN-I8nMl2ntVM6.mp4\n\nLater that same evening, during a corporate dinner, Emilian Gebrev felt the early effects of severe poisoning, with the symptoms quickly worsening until he fell into a coma that evening. A blood and urine sample analysis conducted two months later by the OPCW-accredited Finnish laboratory VERIFIN showed that his vital functions had deteriorated severely, leading to, among other things, kidney failure. Gebrev was hospitalized at the Military Medical Academy in Sofia that same night, with his production director and son hospitalized with similar, albeit less severe, symptoms in the following few days.\nAs Gebrev was succumbing to the first symptoms of poisoning over dinner, “Gorshkov”, “Fedotov” and “Pavlov” took an evening flight from Sofia to Istanbul, and then took a connecting flight onward to Moscow that same night.\nGebrev did not die, nor did the two people who were also poisoned. Four weeks later, on 23 May 2015 “Fedotov” returned to Bulgaria, flying again to the seaside resort of Burgas. According to sources familiar with the investigation, he rented a car and disabled its GPS tracking system, making his movements in the next seven days unknowable. On 28 May 2015, “Georgy Gorshkov” also returned to Bulgaria, landing in Sofia.\nOn the night of 28 May Emilian Gebrev — who was then convalescing at his seaside home a few dozen kilometers south of Burgas — felt the onset of the symptoms he knew all too well. That same night, his son drove him back to the Military Medical Hospital in Sofia.\nThe next day “Gorshkov” and “Sergey Fedotov” drove from Sofia to neighboring Serbia, returning the rented car in Belgrade from where they both flew back to Moscow on 30 May.\n“Georgy Gorshkov” never took another trip again.\nA Diplomat Is Born\n\nShortly after the failed Bulgarian operation, the persona of “Gorshkov” appears to have been decommissioned. However, the real person behind it, Egor Gordienko continued his work for the GRU.\nDuring 2016, he took several flights from Moscow to the Siberian city of Novossibirsk, Krasnodar and Crimea, but his first international trip was not until 2017.\nOn 27 January, he flew on a diplomatic passport from Moscow to Geneva. Judging from a 2018 list, seen by Bellingcat, of all foreign diplomats accredited to Switzerland, Egor Gordienko was accredited as third secretary to the Russian mission at the Word Trade Organization in Geneva. However, Gordienko’s name is not listed in any archived copy of the diplomatic lists published by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Several foreign diplomats based in Geneva told us they have no recollection of meeting Gordienko. However, an unidentified diplomat consulted by the Nightingale blog that first publicized Gordienko’s real name said that they recognized him based on the photograph of “Gorshkov” that was published by Bellingcat.\nThe Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner\nThe only open-source trace of Egor Gordienko’s existence as a member of the Russian mission in Geneva comes in the form of online stats from two marathon runs in Geneva — one from the popular Antigel 5-km run from January 2018, where he apparently finished 90th, with a time of 33 minutes, and a second one from December 2018, where he and his family were signed up but none of them showed up. In both races he is listed as a member of the Russian Mission.\n\nEgor Gordienko signed up for two public run events, one on in January 2018 and a second one in December 2018. He did not take part in the latter one.\n\nKeith Rockwell, WTO’s  Director of External Relations, confirmed to our investigative partner Tamedia that a person named Egor Gordienko was indeed accredited to WTO by the Russian Federation in 2017 on a term that was due to run until 2020 but was terminated prematurely in 2018. Mr. Rockwell said he did not know Mr. Gordienko nor his actual function, and stated that any of the WTO member governments can register any individual as part of their diplomatic mission, subject to authorization by the host country. A spokesperson for the Swiss foreign ministry also confirmed that Gordienko was accredited in January 2017, and that his accreditation was rescinded on 31 October 2018.\nWe attempted to get a clarification on Egor Gordienko’s function at the WTO from the Russian Mission. Tamedia’s query elicited a response from the Russian Mission’s press officer, Daria Rudakova, who wrote that, “We have no information of the above-mentioned person”. A follow-up email pointing to the oddity of a random stranger unknown to Russian officials being accredited to the WTO, and running marathons on behalf of the Russian Mission, remained unanswered. Our partner, The Insider, called Rudakova to follow up on this strange case of diplomatic amnesia. The press officer asked for several hours to investigate the matter, and then proceeded to stop answering her phone.\nPotential Tasks in Geneva\n\nIt is not yet known what Egor Gordienko’s main mission in Geneva may have been. Our review of phone metadata of his Russian phone (which he used primarily while in Russia) shows that in 2017 and 2018 he was in close working contact with Sergeev, Chepiga, Mishkin, and other members of Unit 29155. Thus, we can assume Gordienko’s interests in Switzerland were similar to those of the other GRU team members, or that he provided a supporting role under diplomatic cover.\nBased on our tracking of Denis Sergeev’s mobile phone movements in Geneva, Sergeev appears to have visited the WTO compound on occasion, but this was clearly not his, and not the GRU’s, main interest. Given frequent e-sightings of him at the Lausanne branch of the World Doping Association, the Lausanne Polytechnic Institute, as well as the frequent trips to locations near the ski slopes, it is more likely that those locations, among others, would have been of interest to Gordienko as well. Without metadata for Gordienko’s Swiss mobile number, we are not able to analyze his movements in the same way we did this for Denis Sergeev.\nHowever, it is notable that from December 2017 to February 2018, a constellation of several GRU officers from Unit 29155 traveled to Geneva, including Col. Anatoly Chepiga and Col. Alexander Mishkin, as well as the ubiquitous General Sergeev, whose last trip to Geneva was in late January. On many occasions, these officers several times postponed the return dates for their trips back to Moscow, indicating they were waiting for something to happen, or someone to arrive.\nThese trips occurred only two months before a crucial operation — the poisoning of the former GRU double agent in Salisbury — suggesting a possible link between the two operations.\nEven more indicative of a link may be the trip of at least one officer from Unit 29155 to Geneva late in February 2018, just days before the Salisbury operation. GRU officer Nikolay Ezhov, travelling under his cover identity of Nikolay Kononikhin, arrived in Geneva on 21 February 2018. He had no return ticket, implying that he did not know how long his assignment might last. Ticketing records show that on 1 March 2018, he appeared at the airport at 22:30 and bought a last-minute ticket for a plane to Moscow departing only an hour later. It was that same evening that Sergeev, Mishkin and Chepiga bought their last-minute tickets to fly into London the next day.\nNikolay Ezhov was one of the GRU officers involved with the preparation for the Bulgarian poisoning in 2015, and he stayed in Sofia for approximately two weeks in February and March, presumably tracking and collecting reconnaissance on the target. While his presence in Geneva might well have been part of a different mission, the very small clandestine team of Unit 29155 is unlikely to have had the capacity to work on two important overseas operations at the same time.\nNotably, upon his return to Moscow for the summer recess on 4 July 2018, three months after the Skripal operation, Gordienko immediately called Sergeev, Mishkin, Chepiga and Ezhov, in this exact sequence.\nMeanwhile, the Swiss Foreign Ministry told Tamedia they were not aware of Egor Gordienko’s activities outside his accredited diplomatic function.\nPostus Interruptus\nAt 8:21 p.m. on 25 October 2018, Egor Gordienko bought a last-minute ticket to Moscow for a flight departing at 10:40 that night. He bought a two-way ticket with a return flight for 31 October. However, he never returned to Geneva, and never traveled outside Russia again.\nFlight records show he arrived at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport at 2:45 a.m. His phone metadata shows that at 7:05 a.m. he was already at the GRU headquarters at Khoroshevskoe Chausse 76B. At that time, he called his boss, General Andrey Averyanov, the commander of Unit 29155. He stayed at the HQ address for the whole day, and after 5 p.m. he began calling all his colleagues in sequence, presumably to inform them that he was back for good.\nOn 31 October, Egor Gordienko did drive to the airport after all. However, he did not to take his return flight to Geneva, but to pick up his family, who were also returning home. The family’s names on the 1 December run status website would remain without run-times.\nIt is not exactly certain why Gordienko left suddenly on 25 October 2018. However, it is almost certain that the premature departure was triggered by the waterfall of disclosures on the identity and modus operandi of the clandestine team he was a member of. Only a couple weeks earlier, Bellingcat had identified his colleagues, “Boshirov” and “Petrov”, as Col. Chepiga and Dr. Mishkin, and days earlier his direct superior “Fedotov” had also been outed as Denis Sergeev. And earlier that same day, we had published a lighter story: a case study on how we were able to exactly chrono-locate a 2014 photograph Col. Chepiga had posted from Prague. Little did we know then that Egor Gordienko, a.k.a. “Georgy Gorshkov”, had been in Prague on that same day.\nThe Search for Gordienko                  \nOur search for the real identity of “Gorshkov” was one of the longest and most difficult GRU identification projects. We became aware of a GRU officer traveling under the alias of “Georgy Gorshkov” in October 2018. This became possible following the discovery of another senior GRU officer, “Sergey Fedotov”, who had traveled to the United Kingdom during the time when Sergey and Yulia Skripal were poisoned with Novichok.\nUsing a leaked offline database of flights of Russian citizens in the 2014-2016 period (available as a torrent download from a number of Russian websites), we searched for co-travelers of “Fedotov” having similar passport number series. One of the persons we identified was “Georgy Gorshkov” born 2 February 1977, who had flown with ‘Fedotov” to and from Bulgaria during the time Emilian Gebrev and his son had been poisoned in April 2015.\n“Gorshkov”’s passport differed in only the last two digits form “Fedotov”’s and after their Bulgarian operation, both had returned to Moscow on the same flight from neighboring Serbia.\nWe then tried to obtain a copy of “Gorshkov”’s passport file from a whistleblower with access. We were informed that no such passport file existed, which is consistent with our understanding that Russian security services had begun purging passport files of cover identities following our disclosure of the identities of Col. Mishkin and Col. Chepiga.\nWe were able to obtain a copy of “Gorshkov”’s Russian border crossing records from a different whistleblower. These also contained a poor-quality scan of his latest passport photo. We discovered that the border-crossing records had been meddled with, likely in order to frustrate a possible external investigation.\nDue to the fact that we had a copy of “Gorshkov”’s travel records from the 2014-2016 flight database, we were able to compare the two sets and identified a pattern of data manipulation: all travel records during the Bulgarian operation time-frame had been fast-forwarded three years into the future, showing 2014 trips as having occurred in 2017, and so on. We knew that the correct dataset was the one from the offline flight database, as it had been leaked in 2016, before our identification of the first member of the clandestine GRU team.\nAfter reverse-engineering the border crossing records to match the non-manipulated offline-data set, we found that “Gorshkov”’s last trip under this cover identity was the return trip from the second Bulgarian trip in 2015. Unlike all other members of Unit 29155 identified by us, he never traveled in 2016, 2017 or 2018. This outlying status made us believe he may have been “de-commissioned” from active service or, indeed, might have died.\nOur standard approach to identifying the real identity of GRU officers brought no results. There were no people with the same first name and birth date as “Gorshkov” registered to any Moscow addresses known to be linked to GRU or Spetsnaz bases. We searched for any similar combinations of names and birth dates but to no avail. The identification project for “Gorshkov” had come to a dead end.\nNearly a year later, after our positive identification of Gen. Andrey Averyanov as the commander of unit 21995, we identified his telephone number via a Moscow car registration database leaked in 2018. We then obtained Averyanov’s call records from a whistleblower working at a mobile operator.\nWhile analyzing his records we identified a number that, according to the caller-id app GetContact, belonged to a person named Egor Gordienko. We looked up this person’s name in an offline Russian residential database, and found four Moscow residents with this name combination. None of them were registered at the known GRU addresses, but one of them had a birth date of 2 February 1979. The similarity between the birth dates of 2 February 1977 (Gorshkov) and 2 February 1979 (Gordienko) and the overlap between the first letters in the name led us to the working hypothesis that Gordienko is in fact be the officer behind the “Gorshkov” alias.\nAt this point, we obtained the border-crossing data for Egor Gordienko, which contained a recent photograph. A facial comparison between this photo and “Gorshkov”’s photo gave us a sufficiently high match factor to conclude this was the same person.\n\nFacial match between passport photos of “Georgy Gorshkov” and Egor Gordienko using Microsoft Azure AI Face Verification\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe post An Officer And A Diplomat: The Strange Case Of The GRU Spy With A Red Notice appeared first on bellingcat.",

    "title": "How I Learned French in 12 Months",
    "description": "(Also posted here) From A0 to B2 in a year A bit over a year ago, I was a completely monolingual English speaker with zero experience with the French language. Twelve months later, I very comfortably passed the internationally recognized DELF B2 exam. If you don’t know what “B2” means, check out the CEFR scale. Furthermore, all of my progress was the result of study and practice at home. My learning was entirely self-directed, without any formal programs or immersion. This was only possible through the many amazing resources available online, many of which are free. Furthermore, I succeeded in part because I prioritized receiving quality input and producing output, particularly by spending lots of time talking with fluent French speakers. I will say my learning pace was somewhat aggressive, in that I devoted a lot of time towards learning French over the past year, but it was nowhere near full-time study. I wouldn’t call myself completely “fluent”, but to give you an idea of my level, here are some things I can do without much trouble:   Have fluid conversations completely in French for multiple hours   Understand multiple forms of French media (e.g. news broadcasts, YouTube videos)   Read articles intended for native French speakers   Dream in French \n Of course, I am still very far from native-level proficiency. I definitely have weak points and I can’t express myself in French nearly as well as I can in English. Nevertheless, I’m pretty happy with my level of French and I think many French learners would be too. Why I’m writing this article I know many people want to learn a foreign language, but the task is definitely quite daunting. There are an enormous number of resources, tools, websites, methods, books, apps, classes, and programs out there, some free and others expensive, and it’s hard to figure out which ones to use and when. I definitely spent a lot of time reading about different programs and figuring out whether they would work for me. Now that I’ve reached my goal with learning French, I’m writing this article to show other language learners how I achieved it. Much of what I did should be applicable to those learning other languages too. Nothing I say will be revolutionary – I don’t have some “secret trick” or “foolproof method” – but I think that my experiences over the last year will be useful to someone starting to learn a language. I especially hope that this article helps those who are starting in the same place as I did: monolingual, no prior experience with their target language, no immersion, not studying full-time, and not knowing speakers of their target language. Of course, many people advocate for many different methods to learning a language. I don’t think mine was the absolute best way, but it certainly worked well enough and I think seeing it can provide some valuable insight. Later on I’ll mention some things I’d change if I were to repeat the process, as well as other resources I’ve heard good things about. If you just want to get an idea of what I did in this year of study, I’ll first give a timeline of my French learning journey below. Afterwards, I will discuss many topics in more detail, including what resources I used, what order I recommend using them in, and how to accomplish things as cheaply as possible. I’ll also describe in more detail what I can and cannot do, so that you can get as accurate an idea as possible of what it means to be at a solid B2 level. tl;dr: What I did The most important things, in my opinion, are in bold. Approximate milestones are italicized. Some dates are approximate.   11/18: Complete beginner (A0) excluding basics like “hello, do you speak English?”   11/18: Started going through the French Duolingo tree   12/18: Started listening to French music   1/19: Signed up for the Lingoda half-marathon (now sprint) challenge, starting at A1.2.   1/19: Started occasionally watching Peppa Pig in French (yes, really)   2/19: Changed my phone language to French   2/19: Started lessons on Italki, roughly once a week   3/19: Started (inconsistently) going through the 5000 most common French words deck on Anki   3/19: Quit Lingoda after A2.1, but kept all lesson materials from A1-C2   3/19: Reached the end of the Duolingo tree (level 1 in all skills, but most were level 3+)   5/19: Reached a solid conversational level, maybe low B1.   6/19: Started consistently covering 50 new words a day on Anki   6/19-9/19: Listened to all episodes of the InnerFrench Podcast   6/19-10/19: Went through all A1-B1 saved material from Lingoda   8/19: Finished maxing out the Duolingo tree   9/19: Finished the Anki deck, continued to review afterwards   9/19-10/19: Went through the “Build a Strong Core” program from the maker of the InnerFrench podcast   10/19: I probably reached B2 around here   10/19: Completed the Italki Challenge for October, taking 20 hours of speaking lessons in October   10/19-11/19: Started writing texts on Italki Notebooks and getting them corrected   11/19-12/19: Took 4 lessons with a professional tutor on Italki who specialized in test prep   12/19: Took the DELF B2 exam   12/19: Learned that I passed the DELF B2 with a score of 86/100! \n Technically, I learned a tiny bit of French in the fall of 2018 to prep for a trip to Europe, but only a handful of words and touristy phrases. I started seriously studying French in mid-November 2018 and took the DELF a little under 13 months later, but given that I passed it quite comfortably, I think I actually hit the B2 level around 10-11 months in. What is my level really? I want to expand a bit on what exactly my capabilities and limitations are in French, to give you a more realistic picture of what is achievable in a year of study. I’ve already mentioned some things I can do pretty easily, like have long and fluid conversations and consume French media. Here are some things I can’t really do that well:   Understand strongly accented speech. For example, one of my online tutors recently sent me this video about speaking Quebecois French. I understand essentially all the “standard” French without subtitles, but very little of the Quebecois.   Understand very slang-heavy speech. I know a good chunk of argot but there are still plenty of informal vocab words and expressions I don’t know. Especially that damn verlan.   Write error free text. I can get the message across pretty well without relying on a dictionary, but I often phrase things a bit unnaturally and make minor grammatical errors. For example, here is a screenshot of a correction of part of a text I wrote while prepping for my exam: \n      Quickly use less common verb tenses. While I know how to construct the past conditional and future perfect, I still can’t use them very fluidly.   Recognize all the weird literary tenses. Imperfect subjunctive? Yuck.   Understand everything native speakers say when talking quickly and casually. I can definitely converse with people, but French people are notorious for blending and trimming words when they can. Some things can go over my head in rapid, informal speech.   Understand complex, technical topics. While I can’t always do this in English either, my lack of specialized French vocabulary prevents me from conversing about topics like economics, philosophy, mathematics, and science at more than a basic-to-intermediate level. \n One more limitation: I struggle a bit with French in more “everyday” situations. I’ve spent very little time speaking French in person with people. If you’re fully immersed, you get to cover all the little things: tying your shoes, pointing out a stain on someone’s shirt, passing the ball to someone in a basketball game. I mean, I know all the basics and can convey my intentions in such situations, but my phrasing might be unnatural and I might not know a word here and there. On the other hand, since I spent so many hours just casually talking with people, I got pretty good at having generic conversations. With that said, let’s discuss the B2 exam a bit. Here’s my score distribution for the B2 exam (note passing is 50/100 with 5/25 minimum in each section):    As you can see, speaking (oral production) was my strongest score with a near perfect score. This makes sense, as I devoted a large amount of time to speaking practice, spending around 100 hours in the last year talking with native speakers. During the exam, I was nervous but very fluid while speaking, being able to express my arguments very easily and understanding essentially everything they asked of me. Writing and reading were also quite good with around 90% scores for each. I didn’t really have any problems with either; I fully understood the texts I was given. Listening was definitely my worst section, both in score and general impression. I “understood” all the words from the recordings they played, but having to concentrate for minutes at a time while answering questions simultaneously was something I had very little experience doing. In particular, on the shorter recording (2-3 minutes) where we only got 1 listen, I had only answered 1 question out of 7 when the recording ended, not realizing that the answers to all the questions had already been said. I definitely got some lucky points from guessing on some questions and wouldn’t have been too surprised to have received a score of 10 here. However, I will say that much of the difficulty was format-based, instead of comprehension-based. With a bit more practice with the listening format, I likely would have had an easier time. Reflecting on my French learning experience Before I get into details about my exact method for learning French and what I recommend, I want to share some general thoughts I have about my experience and language learning in general. There is no “perfect” or “easy”, method, including mine Different people learn better using different methods. In this article I will explain what I did and why I think it worked out for me. However, at the end of the day I’m just some random guy who learned French, one of the easier languages for an English speaker to learn, to an upper intermediate level. I’m very, very far from being an “expert polyglot savant” and all of my advice may not be ideal for you. I spent a good chunk of time reading advice online on how to learn French, and while I’ll discuss a lot of useful resources in this article, you should do your own research on what will work for you personally. Of course, don’t spend too much time planning when you could be spending that time actually learning your target language! Contrary to popular belief, watching polyglot videos on YouTube isn’t going to make you fluent! Learning languages in school is very inefficient An incredible number of people have spent many years “learning” languages in school, only to emerge unable to have a basic conversation. How is it possible that I was capable of having full conversations in French within 6 months of learning it then? I firmly believe that learning languages in school, especially in the United States, is generally extremely inefficient. If you struggled learning a language in school, don’t let that affect your confidence with learning a new language now. If you practice intelligently, you can learn much more effectively on your own. You get to avoid doing redundant work that isn’t helping you, and you can spend much more time getting 1-on-1 speaking time with teachers who put all their focus lessons on you. Instead of the language learning process being tailored to a standard government curriculum in a classroom of 20+ students, your language learning journey is completely tailored to you! You don’t have to know that much First, as massive of a task as learning a language seems, take solace in the fact that there are really only a certain number of things you have to learn. You only need to know a couple thousand words and a not-too-large number of grammar rules before you have everything you need to become comfortably conversational. Of course, you need to put in the time to practice what you learn, but once you start picking things up it becomes very enjoyable to see yourself progress. For languages like French, you already have a massive advantage if you’re already fluent in English. There are an enormous number of cognates between French and English, and this means that you can already recognize thousands of French words even if you’ve never spoken a word of French in your life! Furthermore, much of French grammar is similar to English, although of course some things will feel quite weird when you encounter them. It’s a matter of time, not ability Sometimes the language learning process can feel overwhelming. To keep myself motivated, I told myself to believe in the process, and that if I put enough time into things, eventually I’d reach my goal. It turns out I was right! As I said in the previous section, once you know a certain number of words and grammar rules, with some effective practice you will be able to have a solid conversation. If you consistently work on picking up new words and push yourself to address your weaknesses, whatever they may be, you will get there. It’s not a matter of ability; it’s a matter of time. Of course, not all practice time is equal. Make sure your practice is effective practice, and that you’re not just spending all your time watching French movies and calling it a day. Learning languages is frustrating\n So much of the difficulty in language learning is getting over the endless feeling of frustration you encounter. If you’re not feeling frustrated sometimes, you probably aren’t learning much. Watching subtitled movies is fun, but you’re probably not challenging yourself and forcing yourself to learn. Struggling to express an idea in your foreign language is frustrating. Seeing yourself make a grammar mistake you’ve already made 100 times is frustrating. Frustrate yourself enough and you’ll push your boundaries enough to get to the next level. Of course, you shouldn’t frustrate yourself for no good reason, but effective practice often is frustrating! If you truly want to learn, get used to it! (P.S.: When I started off, I sometimes watched this video to re-motivate myself after I got frustrated. Once I reached that level (around 6 months in!), it wasn’t so hard anymore.) The first few months of language learning are really fun because you learn extremely quickly. I remember starting to take some lessons on Duolingo and within a month I could start to understand a good chunk of YouTube comments on French music videos, which really motivated me further. Eventually, you learn all the big stuff – past tense, pronouns, base vocab – and you don’t get to see yourself progress as quickly. In this stage, I couldn’t always tell if I was actually making progress. When this happens, remember, trust the process. The new words you learn will not be as frequent and the grammar rules you learn will be a little more obscure, but as long as you’re learning new things, you’ll gradually notice you make fewer mistakes and things that used to trip you up become second nature. The 5 most important things to succeed (in my opinion) Learning a language is obviously not easy. I can’t be completely certain why I succeeded, but I think some mixture of the traits below were necessary.   Tenacity: You absolutely need to be tenacious to succeed. As I said, language learning can be very frustrating! If you can overcome your frustration, you’ll be well on your way to achieving your goals. Accept it and move on.   Consistency: You need to practice consistently. This doesn’t necessarily mean every single day, but you can’t expect to make much progress if you don’t have some sort of consistency with your learning routine.   Honesty: You need to be honest with yourself (and your tutors and teachers) about your weaknesses. Do you best to identify what your weaknesses are, and force yourself to work on them.   Curiosity: So much of what I learned was from trying to figure out something that didn’t make sense to me. Maybe I found an expression that turned out to be an idiom, or a verb was conjugated differently than I expected. In these cases, I either searched online or asked my online tutors until I found a satisfactory answer. If you don’t address your weak points, they will always remain weak points!   Independence: If you’re self-studying your target language, you’ll need to take charge of the process. I didn’t have anyone to tell me what to do everyday, and in the end I designed my own language learning process. Do your research, and with enough tips and advice (like with this article, hopefully) you’ll find out roughly what you need to do. Then, execute! \n Resources I used and recommend Now I’ll go into more detail about the various resources I used and how I recommend using them. Duolingo Duolingo is a popular platform that teaches a lot of basics for various languages. Most people use the Duolingo mobile app, but there is also a desktop version. Duolingo was the primary tool I used to learn the basics of French. Why I recommend Duolingo While I can’t speak to the effectiveness of other popular platforms for beginners, I found Duolingo really useful for getting a firm grasp of the basics. If you are using a well-established course, Duolingo can get you a long way towards reaching a lower intermediate level, at least in reading and writing. Duolingo gets a lot of criticism as a language-learning platform, and I actually agree with much of this criticism if you use Duolingo ineffectively. As much as Duolingo likes to tell you this, 5 minutes a day of fumbling around with the mobile app isn’t going to make you fluent. If you use Duolingo as I explain below, it can serve as a very effective and useful resource. Using Duolingo effectively There are a few key points I want to give about using Duolingo effectively:   Use the desktop version   Turn off the word bank   Ensure the course you’re using has good reviews   Read the tips included with each lesson, if available   Read sentence discussions for tricky sentences \n Use the Desktop Version of Duolingo I started off with using the Duolingo mobile app, but quickly permanently switched to the desktop version. While Duolingo is mostly known for it’s mobile app, the desktop version of Duolingo is superior to the mobile version, for multiple reasons:   No heart system. You can do as much as you want without getting blocked by your errors. This is essential to getting sufficient practice in to make rapid progress.   Complete access to additional resources, like the forum. You can see individual sentence discussions on the app, but not the entire forum.   Better text input. I find it more convenient to enter my text input on my computer than on my phone. Plus, you get to more easily type in accents if you configure your keyboard settings (I use the US International Keyboard with dead keys.)   Better exercise formats. I personally found certain mobile exercises to be less effective than those available on the desktop version. \n If you have to use the mobile app, make sure you turn off the word bank and view sentence discussions, as I explain below. Turn off the Word Bank I think turning off the word bank is absolutely crucial for learning effectively. By turning off the word bank, you are forced to type out the sentences exactly and really get good practice in. You are no longer practicing recognition but recall. It’s so much easier to forget and confuse words and spellings if you don’t have to type in the words yourself and actually remember them exactly. Without the word bank, your spelling will be vastly superior, you will internalize grammar better, and your vocab retention will be much greater. The word bank is for people who want to feel like they’re learning without actually putting up with the frustration that producing your own output gives you. Ensure the course you’re using has good reviews From my understanding, Duolingo courses are mostly created from the efforts of volunteers, and thus tend to have significant differences in several aspects: audio quality, amount of grammar notes available, forum participation, depth of content, etc. Certain Duolingo courses have really good reviews. From my experience with the French and Spanish for English Speakers courses, they are both pretty well executed. I’ve also heard good things about a few others, like German, Esperanto and Norwegian. I’ve also heard that some courses are pretty low quality, like Japanese and Mandarin (although things might have changed recently.) Some courses, like Italian, are pretty short and so you can’t reach as high of a level using Duolingo. Other courses don’t have any tips or notes at all, so you’re doomed to fumbling around aimlessly! If you’re picking up a language on Duolingo, make sure you read reviews of those courses online before investing a lot of time in them. Read the tips included with each lesson, if available For many courses, Duolingo provides grammar tips for some or all lessons. I found the tips tremendously helpful for preparing for a lesson and being able to quickly understand why certain sentences are said in certain ways. However, be aware that the tips don’t contain everything that you need to know, and so to address that, you should: Read sentence discussions for tricky sentences The Duolingo forum can sometimes be a useful resource. However, the most useful parts of the forum are the individual sentence discussions, where you can find an enormous number of helpful explanations for many sentences. In particular, for the French course, I often found detailed explanations of tricky concepts and idioms found in the sentence discussions, especially by the wonderful course contributor Sitesurf. Other suggestions for using Duolingo Duolingo Quirks Duolingo definitely has its quirks, even within the most well-developed courses, which can sometimes be annoying. For example, sometimes you’ll submit a correct translation which isn’t accepted. This is occasionally frustrating, but ultimately it’s impossible for Duolingo to recognize all possible correct sentences, so in these cases you’ll have to adjust your answers into the “Duolingo style”. They accept more translations over time; I get occasional e-mails saying they now accept a translation I reported as correct. Some people also complain that some sentences are nonsensical (e.g. “I found a dinosaur eating a carrot in my bathtub.”) Ultimately I don’t mind this sort of thing, because the point is to teach you vocabulary and grammar, while possibly adding a little humor in the mix. You shouldn’t focus on the individual sentences and how “plausible” they are but instead on making sure you understand the underlying foundation behind how the sentences are constructed. Getting through the Duolingo Tree I went through the entire French tree, taking each skill to level 5. I actually did this when the format was a bit different than it is today, so level 5 meant doing the same skill more than 5 times. However, I think that was excessive, and now I think 5 or so times per skill is a reasonable amount. You could maybe trim this down to 3 times per skill, but I’m not convinced that’s a great idea. With the old level format this took me many months of consistent effort, around 9 months. However, I think I spent too much time on redoing lessons on Duolingo, so I probably should have finished several months earlier than that. Keep in mind that I was grinding Duolingo so you should not expect to finish in such a time frame unless you are willing to dedicate significant and consistent effort towards completing the tree. Despite Duolingo’s motivational messages, 10 minutes a day is really not very much. I very roughly estimate that getting through the current French or Spanish trees will take somewhere around 150 hours of solid effort to complete. “Laddering” skills “Laddering” might be the wrong term here, as it also refers to using one foreign language to learn another, but we’ll stick with it here. The method I use on Duolingo, which I’ve seen recommended by others too, is not to grind out one skill at a time to the max, but to gradually go through lessons roughly one level at a time. This allows you to cover lessons over a longer time span instead of cramming them all at once. If that isn’t clear, refer to this picture for an example:    Italki Italki is a platform that connects language learners to professional tutors and conversation partners. It is the primary tool I used to improve my conversation and speaking skills. There are also other useful functions, like Notebooks, where you can post texts for others to correct. As far as I can tell, Italki is pretty much universally loved by the language learning community, and I completely echo this sentiment. Taking a lot of Italki lessons was largely responsible for the progress I made with my conversation skills. You absolutely NEED to spend a lot of time talking with people, particularly advanced or native speakers of your language, in order to make significant progress understanding native speakers and speaking yourself. I started taking 1-on-1 lessons on Italki about 3 months in, once I had a solid enough beginner vocabulary and could form some basic sentences. I think this was a pretty good timeline for me, but you can certainly start earlier if you want. I think it’s inefficient to, for example, learn basic vocabulary and grammar through Italki, but you can use it as an early way to practice good pronunciation, get access to useful resources, and get advice on the language learning process. Finding Teachers on Italki There are hundreds on teachers on Italki for all of the major languages, so it can be difficult to figure out how to choose one. My experience is that most teachers are easy to talk to and so ultimately I think it isn’t all that important in the end. Don’t do what I did and stick with one teacher for months (even though she was great) – try different teachers and see which ones you click best with! Using multiple teachers also means you don’t get too accustomed to one person’s way of speaking. Also, teacher ratings are extremely inflated, so 5.0 stars means almost nothing. I initially preferred native French speakers, but after taking lessons with non-native speakers, I found that I couldn’t really tell the difference between natives and non-natives. If you’re a beginner, I think this essentially doesn’t matter at all unless you really want to speak with someone who grew up completely immersed in the language and culture, because every teacher on Italki has a very high level in their language. I also heavily filtered by price for my lessons. I don’t have any experience with more expensive casual teachers, but I found that the less expensive teachers were perfectly adequate for me. If you’re a beginner, I think finding cheaper teachers is likely perfectly fine. More expensive tutors could likely point you to more resources or are more likely to be professionals, but in my opinion all you need to do is spend a lot of time talking unless you’re an advanced student or have very specific goals in mind. If you’re prepping for a proficiency test like the DELF, you can spend some more money on a professional teacher who specializes in test prep. I only did this for four lessons in the weeks before my DELF exam, but I was blown away by my teacher’s preparedness and the sheer amount of help she gave me in specifically prepping for my exam. If you’re studying on your own, such a teacher can really inform you about how to prepare for the test and remove any surprises you might encounter otherwise. If you’re not studying for an exam, then this probably isn’t necessary. Using Italki effectively This section won’t be very interesting, because I think it’s really easy to use Italki effectively: just talk, a lot! Because of my general lack of desire towards specifically working on grammar or exercises with teachers, I spent the vast majority of my time just talking about random topics with my teachers. Sometimes I felt bad that I didn’t really iron out my “weak points” like using certain verb tenses, but in the end, just talking normally for dozens of hours was entirely sufficient to get my speaking to a very solid level. Of course, you can always ask your Italki tutors for specific help, as I did occasionally, but if you do what I did and just say you want to just talk casually for an hour, you’ll probably do just fine. Italki Notebooks I also highly recommend using Italki Notebooks! I should have started earlier, but I only started writing texts on Italki Notebooks pretty close to the end of my learning process. Writing a small text occasionally and getting it corrected will do a lot for correcting small grammatical and structural errors that can plague your writing. As a bonus, I started posting notebook entries and for some reason, random people started correcting them without me asking! It was awesome to receive such detailed feedback, and for some texts that weren’t corrected, I went over them with a teacher during a few Italki lessons. I hadn’t realized that I was making so many mistakes while writing, but after getting my texts corrected I was able to eliminate many of them. If you want to see examples of notebook entries and what notebook corrections look like, you can see my notebook entries on my Italki profile. Shameless plugs Here is a referral link if you want to get started with Italki. I also want to include profile links to some of my favorite teachers that helped me learn French on Italki. I took multiple lessons with all of them and they were all very friendly and easy to have conversations with. Anki Anki is an application that uses a technique called spaced repetition to maximize effectiveness when learning a set of words or concepts, such as vocabulary. You can think of it as an improved flash card system. Anki is extremely effective for internalizing large quantities of information, and for this reason it is popular in the language learning community and unsurprisingly among medical students as well. The interface is a little weird but you get used to it pretty quickly. After getting a solid start through the beginner stage, I started to use Anki to boost my vocabulary. I wasn’t consistent until around 7 months in, but after a few months, I had solidified thousands of French words into my head and greatly improved both my comprehension and production skills. Many people advocate for making your own Anki deck, but I was too lazy to do this and instead went through the 5000 most common French words deck. Similar decks are available for several other languages. The French deck is available here. My routine was 50 new words a day, while reviewing all previous words. I almost exclusively used the French to English deck, although the English to French deck is probably also very useful. After a few months of consistent practice I was able to get through the entire deck. This was a pretty aggressive pace, as towards the end I had to go through maybe 200-300 cards a day in total, but I found it worked well enough for me. InnerFrench Podcast The InnerFrench podcast is a podcast aimed at improving the listening comprehension of intermediate learners. Instead of covering grammar or “boring” topics, Hugo Cotton, the podcast host, talks about a wide range of interesting subjects like “The misfortunes of lottery winners”, “Can we trust our brains?” and “Living on Mars”. The podcast is completely in French. As of early 2020, there are roughly 75 episodes available, with episodes generally ranging from 30 to 40 minutes in length. This podcast was very highly recommended online, so I decided to check it out once I reached a lower intermediate level, around 6 or 7 months in. I finished it within a few months, and by the end, I felt that my listening comprehension had improved immensely. One really nice thing about this podcast is that Hugo speaks somewhat slowly and simply in the earlier episodes as he eases you into listening to French for long periods of time. In later episodes, he speaks more quickly and incorporates more advanced vocabulary and expressions in his speech. This sort of fully French but intermediate level content is exactly the kind of material that helps you bridge the gap from intermediate to advanced listening comprehension, when cartoons are too easy but news broadcasts leave you bewildered. One thing to be aware of is that Hugo talks about a wide variety of topics, some of which are rather political or moral in content (e.g. immigration in France or veganism). I didn’t personally mind this, but Hugo definitely argues for his specific viewpoint, which could rub some people the wrong way. Of course, I hear French people tend to be rather opinionated, so you could just consider this a way of getting used to French culture. Lingoda Lingoda is a platform for taking group or private lessons with professional teachers using the Lingoda language curriculum. Each class lasts 1 hour, has an associated level (e.g. A1.1 or B1.3) and covers a certain topic, like “Mastering the future tense” or “Writing a letter”. A PDF with explanations and exercises is available and used during each class. 2 months in, I started using Lingoda by signing up for their “Half Marathon” (now “Sprint”) promotion, where you get 50% of the cost refunded if you take 45 lessons in 90 days (with some additional restrictions). I didn’t complete the challenge, but made it about halfway through. I think Lingoda is a really good platform for learning one of their available languages. I made reasonably rapid progress with it and had no issues with the content or structure of the classes. Despite this, I ended up stopping lessons on Lingoda and canceling my subscription. This was for several reasons:   I didn’t like having to book lessons 7 days in advance, which seemed to be required starting in the middle of my half-marathon   I don’t particularly like going to classes in general, instead preferring to study on my own or talk casually   I didn’t want to commit to taking a certain number of lessons every month   Italki seemed to be an adequate substitute   Cost \n However, if you like going to class or want to improve really fast, doing a bunch of Lingoda lessons, especially if they’re private lessons, is probably one of the most effective and efficient ways out there. If you’re curious, you can sign up for a free trial and check it out. Lingoda Class Notes I found the Lingoda class notes pretty useful, so I downloaded all notes from A1.1-C2. I didn’t know how to do this automatically so I manually downloaded all of them, which took around an hour and a half. Later on, after around 6 or 7 months of learning, I started going through all the class notes from A1 through B1 to fill in any gaps I had. This meant skimming a lot of things and not really doing the exercises like you would in class, and also not having a teacher to guide me through things. Still, I found this to be a pretty effective resource and reference for various grammar concepts. There were also many units on various specific topics, so I got some exposure to a diverse set of vocabulary this way too. Also note that to reach B2, I ended up not reading (or needing) the B2-C2 notes at all. Of course, you can substitute a good grammar textbook for the Lingoda materials if you’re looking for a grammar resource, but I personally found the PDFs effective enough for my purposes. Reference Websites There were also some websites I visited very regularly: wordreference.com This is a wonderful resource for looking up word definitions and example sentences. If I was ever confused about a word or expression, I searched for it here to learn more. If you use Google Chrome (and maybe other browsers too) you can set up a search engine shortcut to make looking up a word really easy. As an example, if I want to look up the meaning of “attendre”, I can just type “fren attendre” into my address bar to get to the wordreference page for “attendre”. conjugator.reverso.net This is the tool I used to look up verb conjugations. Like with wordreference, you can set up a search engine shortcut to make things fast. For example, I type “rfr attendre” in my address bar to view the conjugation of “attendre”. I found myself on these three sites in particular when I was looking up certain concepts, especially for grammar. They have many excellent articles among them. For example, I often visited this page to review the French subjunctive mood. French Music Listening to music in your target language is an excellent way to get exposed to native pronunciation, learn vocabulary, and motivate yourself to come to understand the language. I have fond memories of finding some French songs and gradually, as I learned new words and my listening comprehension improved, slowly understanding more and more of a song. Sometimes, when I couldn’t help myself, I’d look up the lyrics to a song and find out some interesting vocab, especially weird slang words. Of course, there is a vast discography of French music artists out there, so it’s very likely you can find something you enjoy listening to. If you want some recommendations for good artists who make French music, I recommend Lomepal, Stromae, Eddy de Pretto, Angèle, Roméo Elvis, and L’Impératrice. Don’t be discouraged if you find yourself unable to understand song lyrics very well. At my level, I still struggle with many songs, particularly those that are heavy on slang. However, when I think about it, half of the time I don’t understand what people are singing in English, so take comfort in the fact that sometimes, music is just hard to understand. Also, if you want something fun to do once you reach an intermediate level, you can try a listening test where you listen to a song and try to write down as much of the lyrics as you can. I tried this for a couple songs and I thought it was a cool exercise! If you want to check it out, here and here are my results. Build a Strong Core Build a Strong Core is a 30-day program offered by Hugo Cotton, the creator of the InnerFrench podcast. It aims to help intermediate-level French speakers fix common grammatical errors and better understand native French speakers. Considering how awesome the InnerFrench podcast was, after some deliberation I figured I’d spend the 99 euros and enroll in this course too. A new lesson was released every day, generally including a short video about some France-related topic (e.g. the greater Francophone world) and a short video on some grammar topic (e.g. how French speakers don’t say “ne” orally). There was also an active Facebook group, although I never used it. When I did the program I was already close to a B2 level, so I didn’t get as much out of it than if I were at, say, an A2 level. For example, the speech in the videos was too slow for my taste, so I routinely sped them up to get to a more appropriate speed. Since I got to that level without this program, I personally don’t think this program is necessary, but I still think it is well constructed and possibly worth doing if you’re at the appropriate level. In particular, it excels in getting you used to the speech of native French speakers, with all the syllable-dropping and word-blending they tend to do. While I was able to achieve that using other means, this program would have definitely accelerated that process. Other resources I used I must admit that I watched some Peppa Pig in French on YouTube when I was a beginner. This was somewhat helpful, and consuming media at an appropriate level is definitely a good way of improving your listening comprehension, if you’re actively listening and not just reading subtitles. I also occasionally watched French YouTube videos to practice listening comprehension and “immerse” myself a bit in French culture. You can find a ton of recommendations online for interesting French YouTubers. There’s also the InnerFrench channel for intermediate-level speech. I read “Le Petit Prince” around 9 months in, which was pretty good reading practice. This is the only book I read in French, and I don’t think it was explicitly necessary, but it definitely wasn’t a waste of time. It’s not the easiest book, but I would recommend it to an intermediate learner. Familiarize yourself a bit with the passé simple beforehand. I changed my phone language to French as well, which not only taught me some new words (e.g. stopwatch, settings, unlock) but also put my browser home page in French, which exposed me to a lot of articles in French. Reading these on occasion was good reading practice. I signed up for the News in French e-mail newsletter and read a decent number of the e-mails. I didn’t read anywhere near all of them, but the ones I did read were definitely useful reading practice and taught me many new vocabulary words. The writing is at a relatively advanced level, so I wouldn’t worry much about this until you reach an intermediate level. I listened to the Learn French with Jessica podcast a fair amount as a beginner as well. This podcast is in English, but will help explain some concepts that can be tricky to understand as a beginner (e.g. the weird French counting system, “c’est” vs. “il est”, etc.) For more advanced learners, try the French Voices podcast, hosted by the same Jessica mentioned above. This podcast features full-length interviews in French with many interesting Francophones (e.g. movie directors, scientists, etc.) I didn’t listen to this podcast too much, but not for lack of quality – for an advanced student, this podcast will be excellent listening practice! I also occasionally visited the /r/languagelearning, /r/French, and /r/learnfrench subreddits, more so when I was a beginner. Through these subreddits I discovered many of the resources I discussed above, and also learned a decent amount from some of the French-specific posts. In particular, I came back to this post a few times for inspiration. Once I reached a solid intermediate level, I sometimes visited the /r/France subreddit, which served as interesting reading and taught me some useful vocabulary. Other resources I didn’t use There are a lot of other highly recommended resources out there, most of which I never used. At the end of the day, you can mix-and-match whatever resources you want as long as you hit all the major areas: learning vocab, having conversations, covering grammar bases, etc. Here are some other resources that might be worth checking out:   Pimsleur   Glossika   Assimil   Babbel   Coffee Break French podcast   HelloTalk/Tandem   Movies or TV shows   Books (Harry Potter seems to be a very popular choice) \n A note on movies and shows: this can be a good way to learn things, but I never did this aside from a handful of cartoon episodes early on. However, you must ensure you’re actively learning and not just being lazy and convincing yourself you’re “studying”. In particular, you should try to avoid subtitles in your native language. Subtitles in your target language are better, but if you can get away with it, not using subtitles is probably the way to go if the content isn’t too much higher than your level. Rough “Study Plan” Now that we have discussed the resources I recommend, this is a rough outline of what I would recommend for a language learner based on my experience. Of course, you can find 1000 other people out there with 1000 other learning methods, so feel free to pick and choose. This “study plan” is roughly what I would do if I had to relearn French this year. This is also approximately what I will do for learning Spanish in 2020. First, particularly if you are in need of motivation, you can start looking for French media to consume to motivate you to learn the language. For me, this was music, but for others, TV shows or books could also work. Next, I recommend going through the Duolingo tree for getting through the A1 and A2 levels. Completing the French tree should teach you all the major grammatical concepts and you’ll have a very solid basis for moving onto more advanced material. Of course, ensure you’re using Duolingo as I described earlier in this article to get maximum effectiveness. After getting through a good portion (maybe half or so) of the Duolingo tree, start going through the 5000 most common words Anki deck. Do something like 20 new words a day, reviewing words as they come up. If you start Anki late and already know a bunch of words, then you can bump this up to something like 50 words a day, though that’s pretty intensive. Around the same time, before finishing Duolingo, you can start taking Lingoda lessons if you wish, probably around the A2 level. Whether you do Lingoda or not, start Italki lessons. If this is your only source of conversation practice, try to take more lessons than otherwise. Once or twice a week is a solid enough rate, but if you’re ambitious you certainly can do more. Having casual conversation is perfectly adequate, as long as you get a bit of variety in conversation topics. Once you are near the end of the Duolingo tree, you can start looking for resources targeted at intermediate users. In French, the InnerFrench podcast and YouTube channel are really good for this. You can also start shifting your efforts towards taking more Italki or Lingoda lessons and get more practice speaking and listening, rather than reading and writing. Whatever you do, you will almost certainly notice that you struggle with some aspects of grammar. Consult a reputable grammar resource, but don’t bother spending too much time doing grammar exercises. Instead, try to generally understand the concepts and get practice with them through speaking or writing. I’d also recommend writing on Italki Notebooks periodically, getting your texts reviewed with Italki tutors if necessary. This should help improve your writing ability. The intermediate phase can be tricky, but I think with enough media consumption at an appropriate level, speaking practice, vocabulary work, and patience, you should be able to push through it. Media consumption includes audio-visual media like listening to music and watching movies, but also activities like reading books and articles. If you want to write well, continue writing texts and getting them corrected. Otherwise, be curious and explore what’s out there! Rinse and repeat the last step until B2. Even though I’m only at a B2 level, I imagine getting to C1 (and eventually C2) is the result of continually accumulating more knowledge and resolving weaknesses. For example, you need to learn more technical vocabulary and internalize certain rare grammatical features, things which, at my level, I have not done. Continue to practice speaking and listening skills, and consume a lot of native content in order to know all the little idioms and expressions that feature prominently in true fluency. Immersion likely becomes increasingly helpful to reach these levels, although I suspect you can reach at least a solid C1 at home without too much trouble. Learning cheaply If your budget is tight, here are some tips to minimize your spending while learning your language.   Duolingo is free and unlimited on the desktop version   Italki offers a “Language Exchange” section where you can freely exchange lessons with a native speaker of your target language   Lingoda offers a free trial, if you want to check out their resources \n Otherwise I think everything else is essentially free or not really necessary. You won’t be able to do everything as easily as someone with a big budget, but I think there are enough free resources out there to get to a relatively high level without spending any money. If you do have a little bit of money to spend, then I highly recommend using that money to find teachers on Italki. For many languages you can find cheap tutors, in the $5-$8/hr range. Learning Pronunciation Even though French is notorious for being difficult to pronounce, I actually didn’t have too much difficulty developing good pronunciation. Starting with the first time I spoke French online about two months in, I received compliments on my accent, and even though I made some minor mistakes here and there, things were generally pretty good. I think I got a bit lucky with this part of learning French, but I’ll give some tips about this anyways. I mentioned earlier that “curiosity” and “independence” were really important qualities to have when self-studying a language like I did. I think much of my success regarding developing good pronunciation was really taking charge of figuring out what proper pronunciation was and how to produce it. When I started learning French on Duolingo, I often repeated what I heard out loud to get myself used to pronouncing French words. I replayed and repeated after audio over and over again until I felt comfortable with the pronunciation, to the dismay of some friends who witnessed this. Sometimes things weren’t so clear (Duolingo audio isn’t perfect, though it has gotten better) and other times words were too difficult to pronounce for me (e.g. “voiture” was really hard for a while), but for many of the easier words, I ended up doing decently enough. I also read many articles and watched many videos online about French pronunciation, especially trying to train myself to produce some difficult French sounds, like the “u” and “r”. While I struggled with these for a while, after a month or two I could do them reasonably well. This took a lot of consistent effort trying to produce these sounds, but eventually things started falling into place. Singing French songs in particular helped me practice pronunciation, and in fact the “r” finally clicked for me while I was singing a Stromae song (say “retrouverai” enough times and you’ll figure it out.) Even if you feel silly saying things, at some point you need to force yourself to practice pronouncing them. People who pay attention to pronunciation and force themselves to correct their errors are much more likely to improve than those that are too afraid to sound dumb. If you don’t want to sound dumb, language learning is not for you! For French learners, here are some specific observations about pronunciation that could help you, which were pain points for me in the past:   Nasal vowels, particularly the difference between “-an” and “–in”. I practiced differentiating between “attendre”, “étendre”, “éteindre”, and “atteindre” pretty often.   On that note, the difference between “é” and “è”. It’s subtle and takes a while to get used to.   The pronunciation of “s”. Note “s” is pronounced differently as “ss”, “s” at the end of a word, and “s” not at the end of a word.   “in-” and “im-” at the beginning of words are pronounced differently depending on the next letter in the word. For example, “insensible” and “imparfait” vs. “inevitable” and “innovation”. See if you can figure out the pattern!   Liaisons. You’ll develop an ear for this over time but it’s definitely quite tricky. Read some articles online.   “-oy“ is not pronounced like in “boy” but kind of like “waee”, e.g. in “voyager” or “tutoyer”. “Voyage” sounds like “vwaee-ahj”.   How to pronounce “plus” based on the context. Honestly I still don’t know this completely. \n Lastly, I find French pronunciation to be surprisingly consistent given its reputation. While it’s often impossible to know how a word is spelled just from hearing it, you can usually know how a word is pronounced after seeing it once you get the hang of the rules. Final Words Learning French was an immensely rewarding process for me. It opened up an entire new cultural world to me and instilled in me a love for language learning. While it required a lot of time and hard work, in the end, I think learning a language (especially an “easy” one like French for English speakers) isn’t “hard” in the way that, for example, theoretical physics is “hard”. With enough dedication and effective practice, pretty much anyone can learn a foreign language to a reasonably high level. While a year is a pretty aggressive timeline to learn a language to a high level, it’s clearly entirely feasible if you’re willing to put the time in and work efficiently. I hope my experiences help you on your language learning journey. Good luck!",
