## web idiot

I make stuff on the internet. I read books. I take photos. I write things. The things I write aren’t very good, but I did English at uni so I have to do it anyway.

I’m hard to teach but I’m a good listener. I learn things quickly (when they actually need to be learned). I live in London. I like cities. I hate cars. I’m handy in a pub quiz.

I care about politics. I studied it. I study it. I read the news. The only sports I ever care about happen on snow. Even then I forget to watch them on TV. I don’t watch live TV. I like films and music, and arguing about award shows.

I like people, mostly. I like making things for people. I’ll never make my mind up about what a personal website is for.
