### Articles I've Saved
These are all articles I've saved to Pocket. I'm a heavy user and sometimes use it just to save something very quickly instead of bookmarking it. So it doesn't really serve as a high quality store of good articles, more a stream of consciousness of things I've encountered online. For that, I'd check out the [articles I've starred on Feedbin](/articles/liked).
