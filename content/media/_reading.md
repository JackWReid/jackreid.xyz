### Books I'm Reading
In 2020, I’ve set [my Goodreads target](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54047855-jack-reid) to 80 books. I just about made it last year, albeit with some cynical swiping of slim volumes over Christmas to make up the numbers. As ever, I’m hoping I can read a lot of good fiction (my tendency is to fall down a rabbit hole of fiction on one topic).
