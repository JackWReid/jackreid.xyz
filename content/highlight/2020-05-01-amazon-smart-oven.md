> In general, Elisabeth likes the microwave we own, a GE we call 'Sparky Jr.,' and she was pretty disinterested in the interloper that had taken Sparky's place on our countertop. Her first and last interaction with the Amazon was trying to get it to reheat some pizza. I wasn't around, but she later referred to the 'pizza crackers' it made, even though she stopped the cooking 13 minutes early. She watched me with bemusement for the rest of my testing and while she continued to use Sparky Jr.
