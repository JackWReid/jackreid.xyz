A place to keep things that refuse to stay in my brain.

### Computers
- [A list](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) of all the things that go into the `<head>` element
- The strftime specifiers for [date](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Date-conversion-specifiers.html#Date-conversion-specifiers) and [time](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Time-conversion-specifiers.html#Time-conversion-specifiers)
- [Various tools](https://dogsheep.github.io/) to download locked-in social media content and turn it into SQLite database files or simple web UIs with Datasette

### Medicine
- A coup injury occurs under the site of impact with an object, and a [contrecoup injury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_contrecoup_injury) occurs on the side opposite the area that was hit.
